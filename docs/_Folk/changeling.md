# Changeling
Changelings are the offspring of a humanoid creature and doppelganger. They almost always remain within the humanoid society; doppelganger clans find the half-blood's abilities too limited to be of any use. The changeling is indistinguishable from others of its humanoid parentage until it reaches maturity. Indeed, an accidental change is often the changelings first indication that something is amiss with its heritage.

After maturity, changelings strongly resemble their doppelganger lineage. They fall within the boundaries of Medium size. Unlike true doppelgangers, changelings do have gender in their natural form, although they can adopt any shape they like. Changelings have pale gray skin, and their hair is thin and fair. Their limbs are long and slightly out of proportion compared to other humanoids. Their faces have slightly more distinct features than a doppelganger's, including a hint of nose and lips, though their eyes remain blank white and the rest of their facial features don't look quite as finished as those on a human.

### Quick to Change, Slow to Decide
Many would consider an ability to change their looks at any time a gift, but to the changeling it can seem at times like a curse. Due to fears of prejudice, many changelings spend little to no time in their true form. Some try to have an ordinary life, changing their form rarely. Others take full advantage of their powers, becoming infiltrators, thieves, blackmailers and spies. Yet, some faceless live in their true form, to show others that their kind could be trusted.

Due to their chaotic nature, they change their moods as often as they change their appearance. It's not unusual for changelings to be indecisive and work on more than one task at a time. Their innate ability of changing gives them an uncanny ability to deceive others. Befriending a changeling could either be a blessing, or a disaster.

### Constant Search
Changelings feel a need to search something their whole life. This longing drives them, whether they seek their true self, a place they can belong, or their ancestor. When a changeling takes up adventuring, it might be to fulfill its need. Some get distracted on the way by the fame and fortune, but sooner or later their desire will resurface.


<h3><a class="internal-link" name="internal-Traits">Traits</a></h3>

As a changeling you get a some traits that you share with the others of your kind.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Duplicity**. The *Perception - Insight* and *Speechcraft - Deception* skills costs 0 to you.

- **Magic resistance**. You have advantage on saves against any spell or effect that would alter your form.

- **Languages**. You can speak Common and two other languages of your choice.

- **Shapechanges**. As an ***action***, you can transform your appearance or revert to your true form. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your true form if you die. This is a physical transformation, not an illusion, but you do not gain the powers of other races when you mimic them.

  You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. Your basic shape stays the same; you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

The following feats are exclusive to changelings.

<div class="columnstwo">

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Beastly Forms
    With enough training, your ability to change form has improved so well that you can now take forms of beasts.

    You can now use your Shapechanger trait to turn into a beast that you have seen, of a similar size and shape as you. While you are transformed into a beast, your AC is replaced by the beast's AC and you lose your ability to speak. Other than that, your statistics do not change.

    If the creature you are transformed into has a swimming or climbing speed, you gain that speed. If it has a swimming or climbing speed that's higher than your movement speed, you only gain that speed equal to your movement speed.

    While transformed into a creature with horns, claws or other natural weapons, you have natural weapons, which you are proficient with. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.

    </div>

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Defensive Shift
    You can use your shapeshifting to harden your skin to better protect yourself against physical assault.

    Your **Constitution** score increases by 1.

    When you take non-magical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to gain resistance to that damage type. This resistance lasts until the start of your next turn and applies to the triggering damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and regain all uses after a short rest.

    You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist both magical and nonmagical effects that detect your thoughts, emotions or compel you to tell truth. Additionally, you can present false thoughts, emotions, or lies as if you are being truthful by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check.

    You can cast *detect thoughts* and *Nystul's magic aura* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast both spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. You can cast them without requiring components, but effects of Nystul's magic aura can't become permanent if it's casted this way for 30 days.

    While you are in your true form, you can cast *nondetection* on yourself without expending a spell slot, requiring no spell components. When you cast the spell this way, it ends immediately if you are no longer in your true form, whether by using your Shapechanger trait, or when you are transformed. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
