# Gnome

As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.

Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.

> *"Skinny and flaxen-haired, his skin walnut brown and his eyes a startling turquoise, Burgell stood half as tall as Aeron and had to climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most habitations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could.*
>
> *But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage's familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep."*
>
> -- Richard Lee Byers, *The Black Bouquet*

#### Vibrant Expression
A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.

A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trim med but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

#### Seeing the World
Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a  quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.

#### Gnome Names
Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions.

When dealing with humans and others who are stuffy about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category  the most fun to say.

<div class="columns">

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Ability Score Change**. Your Luck ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2, while your Strength ability score, both current and maximum, is reduced by 4.

- **Age**. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

- **Subtype**. There are three types of gnomes; forest gnomes, rock gnomes (also known as tinker gnomes), and the more uncommon deep gnome.

</div>

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-forest">Forest Gnome</a></h1>

The rare and secretive forest gnomes, have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Ability Score Increase**. Your Wisdom ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2.

- **Languages**. You know Common and Sylvan.

- **Natural Illusionist**. You know the *minor illusion* cantrip. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

- **Speak with Small Beasts**. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.

</div>

<h3><a class="internal-link" name="internal-forestfeats">Forest Gnome Feats</a></h3>

Your forest gnome character has access to the following special feats.

<div class="columnstwo">

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Critter Friend
    Your friendship with animals mystically deepens.

    Increase your **Wisdom** score by 1.

    You gain proficiency with Animal Handling. If already proficient, you instead have advantage on all check made with the skill.

    You learn the *speak with animals* spell and can cast it at will without expending a spell slot. You also learn the *animal friendship* spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

    </div>

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Fade Away
    You can draw on your magical heritage to escape danger.

    Increase your **Wisdom** score by 1.

    When you take damage, you can use a ***reaction*** to magically become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short rest.

    </div>

</div>




<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-rock">Rock Gnome</a></h1>

As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. These are the types of gnomes most common, and the ones that people usually associate to when hearing about gnomes.

A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where the rock gnomes form their closeknit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

<div class="columnsthree">

- <img src='https://robertrigo.github.io/pics/gnome_explosion.png' style='width:80%;padding:20px' />

- **Ability Score Increase**. Your Intelligence ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2.

- **Languages**. You know Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

- **Artificer's Lore**. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you have advantage.

- **Tinker**. You have proficiency with tinker's tools. Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

  When you create a device, choose one of the following:

-  -- ***Bouncing Boots***. A pair of metal-reinforced boots with multiple coils and a ratchet-system between a steel innersole and a leather-bottomed outer sole, bouncing boots are guaranteed to add a spring to anyoneâ€™s step. Using them requires unlocking them by hand and jumping upwards to â€˜prime themâ€™. Six seconds after landing, the timed ratchet releases and the coils unwind violently, propelling the wearer 15 feet. A successful untrained Athletics (Dexterity) check against DC 10 allows the wearer to guide this sudden movement in any direction desired; otherwise the jump occurs in a random direction. Colliding with a solid object larger than the wearer during a jump results in 1d6 points of damage. When the user lands, he must spend his next round relocking the boots. Failure to do so results in another 15-foot jump the next round.

-  -- ***Clockwork Toy***. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

-  -- ***Fire Starter***. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your ***action***.

-  -- ***Music Box***. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

-  -- ***Shield, Retractable***. Due to the ingenuity of gnomes, the retractable shield has come from the depths of imagination to the reality of the battlefield. Though it initially appears to be the size of a buckler, the retractable shield can be expanded with the pulling of a release key. Upon release the fans that make up the retractable shield spread out and become a large shield. Retractable shields require one minute to retract to their original state and this is done by turning the key until the fans that make up the shield lock into place.

-  -- ***Shield, Widowmaker***. This strange, gnomish device appears to be an ordinary shield with pyramidlike protrusions around the periphery. The shield works similarly to a bear trap in that, when the shield is struck and the character releases the trip-cord, it snaps shut. Thus, if an opponent misses the bearer of a widowmaker shield by two or less on an attack roll, the character may choose to release the trip-cord and have the shield attempt to close on the opponentâ€™s weapon. The opponent must make a Dexterity save (DC 10) or have the item they were wielding become trapped in the shieldâ€™s grip (Strength check DC 10 to break the widowmakerâ€™s grip). If the opponent was using his bare fist to strike at the character with the widowmaker and they fail their save, their hand becomes trapped instead. Once a widowmaker shield is triggered the character loses the AC bonus from the shield. A widowmaker shield takes one minute to reset.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-deep">Deep Gnome</a></h1>

Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.

#### Born of Deep Earth
Svirfneblin seem more like creatures of stone than flesh. Their leathery skin is usually a gray, brown, or dun hue that acts as a natural camouflage with the rock around them. Their bodies are gnarled with hard muscle or fat, and they are heavier than their small stature suggests; svirfneblin often weigh 100 pounds or more but rarely stand much more than 3 feet tall.

Male svirfneblin are bald from early childhood, although adults can grow stiff beards or mustaches. Females have full heads of hair, and they usually tie their hair back in braids or cut it short to keep it from getting in their way as they work.

Svirfneblin are well adapted for their subterranean existence. They have excellent darkvision, and many of them have magical talents that rival the innate spellcasting of the drow and duergar. They are surprisingly strong for their size, enduring toil and danger that would overwhelm most other people.

#### Deep Gnome Names
Svirfneblin prefer less flamboyant names than their rock gnome or forest gnome cousins. Clan names reflect skills or occupations that a particular family is associated with, and sometimes change if a noteworthy individual strikes out in a new direction.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Male Names**: Belwar, Brickers, Durthmeck, Firble, Krieger, Kronthud, Schneltheck, Schnicktick, Thulwar, Walschud

- **Female Names**: Beliss, Durthee, Fricknarti, Ivridda, Krivi, Lulthiss, Nalvarti, Schnella, Thulmarra, Wirsidda

- **Clan Names**: Crystalfist, Gemcutter, Ironfoot, Rockhewer, Seamfinder, Stonecutter

</div>


### Deep Gnome Traits
Short-lived compared to other gnomes, deep gnomes mature at the same rate humans do and are considered full-grown adults by age 25. They live 200 to 250 years, although toil and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before their time.

Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies, so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill, and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others, except those dearest to them.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Ability Scores**. You do not apply the gnome ***Ability score changes***.

- **Languages**. You know Undercommon.

- **Darkvision**. For 30 ft around you, you can see in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

- **Stone Camouflage**. You have advantage on Dexterity (stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain.

</div>

### Deep gnome Feats
Your deep gnome character has access to the following special feat.

<div class="columnstwo">

- <img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/90/26/2c9026f388484b38d3b0ccf07e32bf06.png' style='width:80%;padding:20px' />

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Pickaxe Mastery
    Your time spent wielding a pickaxe allows you to wield it with devastating efficiency.

    Your **Dexterity**  or **Strength** score increases by 1.

    You are proficient with pickaxes and can use tham as if they had the finesse and versatile properties, dealing 1d8 piercing damage (1d10 when used with two hands).

    Whenever you attack with a pickaxe, you can swing wildly, causing your attack to have disadvantage. If you hit, you deal additional damage equal to double your proficiency bonus.

    Whenever you have disadvantage on an attack roll you make with a pickaxe, the target still takes piercing damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.

    </div>

-   <div class="feat">

    ## Svirfneblin Magic
    You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors.

    Your **Charisma**, **Intelligence** or **Wisdom** score increases by 1.

    You can cast *nondetection* on yourself at will, without needing a material component.

    You can cast each of the following spells once: *blindness/deafness, blur*, and *disguise self*. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

    Choose Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these spells. The spells are cast at their lowest possible levels.

    </div>

</div>






## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-class">Gnome Class Options</a>

An gnome approaches some classes is a bit different than other races. When you select one of these classes, it is modified as follows:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### Alchemist
    **Rock gnomes** like explosions and naturally gravitate toward the mad bomber archetype. Whenever the Alchemist class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Barbarian
    Gnomes are not really built for this class. They neither have the physique, nor the anger that makes for a fearsome barbarian.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Bard
    A gnome bard can use his bardic inspiration to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him.

    <div class="feat">

    ## Mock
    You can mock a number of creatures up to 1d6 + your proficiency modifier. Each target must be able to see, hear, and understand you. They receive a Wisdom save (DC 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). If the saving throw succeeds, you cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm you. You can maintain this as a concentration effect, allowing the mocked creatures a new Wisdom save at the end of each of its turns. While you maintain the mocking, the targets has disadvantage on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully damaged you.

    </div>

    In addition, whenever the Bard class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- <img src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q5vSB2QKzMs/UR1WjXBncEI/AAAAAAAAExg/f2n70fdm1bg/s1600/Rosie+Cusswell.png' style='width:65%;padding:20px' />

- ### Cavalier
    **Forest gnomes** get very well along with all kinds of animals, and they can be seen riding all kinds of animal, from badgers to moose. With the help from their friends they are very adept on the back of a ridden animal.

    Whenever the Cavalier class description mentions your Strength or Charisma modifier, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. This also applies to attack and damage rolls.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cleric
    Gnomes are like most other humanoids in regards of religion.

    If you are a cleric following a gnome deity and one of its domains, then whenever the cleric class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cursed
    Due to their curiosity, rock gnomes have a higher amount of cursed than any other race. However, any gnome can be cursed.

    You may choose Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability instead of Intelligence. You make this choice at level 1 and cannot change this later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Druid
    **Forest gnomes** are very much in tune with nature and gain the **critter friend** feat at level 1. In addition, whenever the druid class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Feyblood
    **Forest gnomes** commonly gain the Sidhe or Sprig affinity, and if so, gain the **fade away** feat at level 1.

    **Rock gnomes** most commonly have the pooka affinity, and if so, gain +2 to their Luck ability.

    **Deep gnome** often have the oread affinity, and if so, gain the ***svirfneblin magic*** feat at level 1.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Fighter
    **Deep gnome** fighters may can add the following fighting style to their selection of fighting styles.

    <div class="feat">

    ## And then I did anyway...
    They told you it was too big and that you shouldnâ€™t train with it. And then you did anyway. Through perseverance, you have managed to overcome your size. You can use weapon with the Heavy property without disadvantage.

    </div>

    **Rock gnomes** have access to the <a href="#internal-tinkerKnight">Tinker knight</a> archetype.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Inquisitor
    Gnomes mostly ignore the religious practices of other creatures, so the inquisitor role does not really exist.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Paladin
    Paladins are very rare but they do exist among gnomes, and are then the embodiments of the heroic ideals for their race. This often confuses people when they first meet a gnome paladin, as they expect a paladin to follow the human ideals.

    Suitable archetypes are *oath of the ancients* for forest gnomes, *oath of tomorrow* for rock gnomes and *oath of tradition* for deep gnomes.

    Whenever the Paladin class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    In addition you can add the fighting style from the fighter entry to your selection of fighting styles.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Professional
    **Rock gnomes** can become very good professionals, not necessarily because they are good at crafting, but because of their love for experimentation. This mostly ends in disaster, but can also result in great leaps of progress.

    **Deep gnome** societies are usually completely isolated from other settlements, which forces them to have specialists of different kinds. However, they tend to prefer and value the more practical fields, like the candlemaker, cook or smith.

    If you are a deep gnome in a more practical field, or a rock gnome, then whenever the Professional class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Ranger
    As a gnome ranger you have access to the <a href="#internal-trickster">Trickster conclave</a>.

    Whenever the Ranger class description mentions your Wisdom modifier you may instead your proficiency bonus. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking (attack and damage). Make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    Finally you can add the fighting style from the fighter entry to your selection of fighting styles.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Rogue
    **Forest gnomes** are really sneaky. You may use your Dexterity modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus when calculating AC and when attacking (to hit and damage).

    In addition, when using sneak attack, you can opt not to use all your sneak attack dice. For each die you did not use, you gain a +1 to AC until the start of your next turn. Note that you can sneak attack using 0 extra damage dice.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Sorcerer
    Sorcerers are just as rare and varied as within other folk.

    Whenever the Sorcerer class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    A **forest gnome** sorcerer may add one illusion spell per spell level from any class list to its spell list.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Swashbuckler
    As **forest gnomes** and **rock gnomes** are usually too weak to use heavier armor, the swashbuckler class is preferred over the fighter class.

    Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    In addition you can spend 1 panache to use ***mock***, as the gnomish bard.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Warlock
    Just as any other folk, gnomes sometimes want to take shortcuts to power, safety, knowledge or, as is the case for rock gnomes, just for curiousity and fun.

    Whenever the Warlock class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Wizard
    **Rock gnomes** are very curious and some become fascinated with the arcane arts. Whenever the Wizard class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. You may only do this if you are literate.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-race">The Gnome Race</a></h1>

Love of discovery is the force that drives the life of a
gnome, whether one is investigating the nature of magic
or trying to invent a better back scratcher. Questions
about the world fill a gnome's head: how an insect flies,
a fish swims, or a grasshopper jumps -they want to
figure it all out! But it's not just nature and its workings
that intrigue them; gnomes become obsessed with all
sorts of topics. In particular, they have a keen interest in
mechanical devices, the natural world, and magical pursuits;
a gnome might seek to invent a new garden tool,
collect and categorize every type of butterfly, or develop
a new method for cutting gemstones.

> *"And then the whole thing exploded into a million jillion pieces! {gasp} I never saw anything like it in my life!"*
>
> -- Griballix, gnome of Sigil


## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-drinkingDeeplyLife">Drinking deeply of life</a>
A gnome is rarely bored and tries to savor every minute,
for life is full of opportunities to learn, to help others,
and to have fun.

Gnomes are born with a fascination for learning fueled
by an irrepressible curiosity. Most individuals settle
on a specialized area of study such as an aspect of the
natural world, a particular method of invention, or the
patterns that underlie the multiverse.

Though this pursuit of knowledge might compel a
gnome to spend long periods in the workshop or the laboratory,
the activity is never seen as drudgery -quite the
opposite. Gnomes enjoy making an unexciting aspect
of life more enjoyable, such as inventing a shovel that
whistles a tune to lighten the toil of digging, or creating
a telescoping fork that can reach across the table to enliven
mealtime.

Their fun-loving attitude also comes through in the
form of jokes that gnomes tell to, or about, their companions,
and in the good-spirited pranks that they play
on each other-and on other folk (who might not always
appreciate being the target of their humor).

#### The journey is the destination
Gnomes aren't overly goal-oriented as they pursue their
interests. To them, the journey and the destination are
one and the same, and an achievement at the end of
one journey is merely the first step toward the next accomplishment.

Even though failure, disappointment, and dead ends
are recurring obstacles on the path to discovery, gnomes
revel in the search. They savor the acquisition of new
knowledge, realizing it might come at a cost, and even a
series of bad results in experiments doesn't dissuade a
gnome from following their chosen path.



## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-rockGnomes">Rock Gnomes</a>
A visitor's first steps into a rock gnome warren are accompanied
by the sounds of industry -hammers rapping
on metal, chisels chewing wood, cauldrons bubbling,
and a host of assorted squeaks, pings, and whistles.

Against this backdrop, the halls echo with the voices of
rock gnome inventors jabbering at near unintelligible
speed about their latest ideas, and the hubbub is occasionally
punctuated by a big bang or the abrupt collapse
of some unstable contraption.

To rock gnomes, life is a combination of scavenger
hunts and periods of bold experimentation. First they
mine materials from within the earth, and then they
figure out what they can create or invent using those resources.

<img src='https://robertrigo.github.io/pics/gnome1.png' style='float:left;width:40%;padding:20px' />

The discovery of a new vein of metal -whether
tin, copper, silver, or gold- makes rock gnomes clap
their hands with glee, but they are happiest of all when
they find a cache of gems, particularly diamonds.

Individual rock gnomes have different ideas about
what sorts of inventions are the most satisfying to create,
with some favoring practicality and others more
interested in artistic expression. In each group, there
are those who prefer to practice the alchemical arts and
those whose talents lean toward the creation of mechanical
devices. Every warren has members of each persuasion,
and they are all bound by mutual respect for what
they do despite their different perspectives.

#### Practical makes perfect
Rock gnomes who take a more scientific approach to
inventing are the ones responsible for creating technological
devices that make life easier. Even an invention
as simple as a new kind of rake is celebrated, and that
advance might later be superseded by someone who
modifies it in a way that makes it more efficient or more
enjoyable to use.

These inventors are rarely reluctant to try making
devices of exceptional power, even if one might not work
at first the way it was intended to. The gnomes know
that it's always possible for someone else to learn from
an inventor's mistakes, so even a failed experiment is
a success in some way. Every minor explosion or other
incident of turmoil in a rock gnome burrow serves as a
clue about what not to do next time -unless, of course,
the goal was to make something explode.

#### For beauty's sake
Imagination runs wild in the mind of a gnome. Any fresh
idea can be the starting point for a new journey of experimentation and discovery. Even though rock gnomes
appreciate the practical aspects of their endeavors,
they also find satisfaction in creating items that have no
true usefulness. Many an invention is celebrated just
for being beautiful to behold or for being complex and
intricate in its construction, and the artists who create
such things are as esteemed as those who specialize in
designing tools.

Exploration is a part of invention, as the gnomes see
it, so there's nothing wrong with creating machines and
artifacts that seem to have no purpose. The gnomes who
produce these works of art are using new ideas and new
approaches, breaking through old boundaries and advancing
the frontier of knowledge. For instance, an artist
might create a beautiful articulated sculpture whose
pieces can be manipulated in a unique way. Another
artisan might take that idea and apply it to a new form of
invention -but no one forgets that it was the artist's idea
that blazed the trail for that journey.

#### Alchemists
Rock gnome alchemists explore the nature of minerals
and chemicals, curious to see what happens when they
mix certain substances with other compounds or with
raw magic. Most alchemists, even those who busy themselves
with experimentation and new ideas, can produce
a number of useful substances, such as alchemist's fire,
antitoxin, super slippery goo, stone melting compound,
stirge repellent, and glow-in-the-dark paint.



#### Artificers
Rock gnome artificers construct exquisitely tooled and
enameled pieces of machinery, often weaving magical
properties into their work. Artificers often develop a reputation
for a particular style and type of work. For example,
a friendly gnome artificer might create lovable mechanical
pets and companions, while a grumpy gnome
might make snapping critter constructs with sharp teeth
and claws. Gnome artificers can become famous, with
their works highly sought after by nobles, wizards, and
other collectors.

An artificer's inventions might include items such as a
lock box that opens with a verbal command or a series
of gestures, a clockwork critter designed to respond to
simple commands, or a common magic item.

#### Tinker gnomes
Some gnomes take invention to extreme heights and are known
for being purveyors of madcap mayhem. Despite losing
body parts or gaining scars from various accidents, nothing
stops the tinker gnomes' insatiable quest to experiment
and discover.

**Go Big or Go Home**. The creations of tinker gnomes
range from the ridiculous to the dangerous. They love to
push the art of invention beyond its limits, and to explore
the instability of volatile materials. They cackle with glee
after an ear-splitting bang, and jump and cavort amid
lethal sprays of lightning. Though it might be bizarre and
unusual, a working tinker gnome creation is a rare thing,
and highly prized. Such inventions include the following:
* A chain-driven tomato smasher that is also able to fly
* A lightning-powered portable rat-zapper: good for keeping out the vermin
* A floating metal facsimile of a beholder, complete with disintegrating eye rays
* A flock of exploding parrots

**Fail Often, Fail Happy**. These inventors are delighted
by every explosion, every melted mess, and every heap of
smoking wreckage. Failure is part of the eventual solution
and something to be celebrated. A truly epic failure might
be cause for a great celebration in the community.

#### Tunnel Vision
When they are at work, rock gnomes hole up in their
workshops with "Do Not Disturb" signs hung on the
door. It isn't uncommon for gnomes who are working on
their projects to spend most of their time in seclusion,
and even when they emerge (for meals or other reasons),
they are often deep in thought and oblivious of their
surroundings. In the safety of the burrow, they seldom
come to harm because of this vulnerability. But even
city-dwelling gnomes can fall prey to this sort of obsession
as they pursue their projects, and in such cases
it's much safer for them to stay in their homes, since a
gnome wandering the streets deep in thought is liable to
walk into a moat or be run over by a wagon.




## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-forestGnomes">Forest Gnomes</a>
As the companions of nature and its animals, forest
gnomes learn from their surroundings as if from a master
teacher. They evade incursions into their wooded
realm by great numbers of humans and other races, but
they aid individuals and small groups whom they deem
worthy of their help. They create lovely gardens, organic
sculptures, and wondrous emerald jewelry- that precious
green stone being their favorite of all gems.

Forest gnome settlements often escape notice. Roving
hunters can wander through without ever suspecting
they are walking through anything but wilderness. A
community of elves might be surprised to discover they
have been neighbors of a forest gnome village for years.

Forest gnomes are good at making their homes vanish
into the landscape. It helps that they are small folk, and
that they fashion their homes by digging down and living
within rather than building up and living above. Like
the badgers and raccoons that are often their companions,
they live in the hollows of trees and warrens dug
into hillsides, each home connected to the others in the
community by elaborate burrows.

Beyond the secret doors into their houses, the homes
of forest gnomes are gaily decorated, tidy spaces that
take advantage of natural features. A great glass bowl
swimming with fish and frogs might serve as a skylight
for a gnome burrow, while appearing to the world above
as a small pond. The gnarled and tangled roots of a tree
might be used for shelves, seats, tables, and bed spaces.
Such houses often have many little channels open to
the outside, allowing scraps of sunlight to dapple the
walls and floors and providing a means of egress for the
many animals that live with the gnomes. Similar small
openings are used for their cleverly hidden chimneys,
disguised as tree branches, which carry smoke from
their small fires high into the treetops, reducing it to little
more than a haze before it disperses.



<img src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/confanon/images/c/c9/Forest_Gnome.gif/revision/latest?cb=20110805161434' style='float:right;width:30%;padding:20px' />

#### Animal helpers
Forest gnomes can communicate with many of the
small animals of the woods. Squirrels, raccoons, foxes,
weasels, owls, rabbits, robins, hummingbirds, and more
are their allies and friends. Outsiders often think of
these creatures as the gnomes' pets, but the gnomes
treat them more like trusted neighbors.

When strangers approach a woodland inhabited by
forest gnomes, the gnomes often know about it while
such visitors are still miles away. Speedy squirrels run
through the treetops, each trying to be the first to warn
the gnomes and earn a sweet treat. Birds trill a special
call that alerts the gnomes to danger. At night, nocturnal
animals such as owls and bats carry word to the gnomes
during times when they should be on their guard.

#### Experts in illusion
Forest gnomes have innate magical ability, letting them
create simple illusions. They practice the use of illusion
magic from an early age. Most forest gnome communities
include a full-fledged illusionist and an apprentice or
two, and they use their talents in service of the community-
designing longer-lasting or larger-scale illusions
that help the community stay hidden from the world.

Gnomes use illusions for practically any reason -as
a game, for defense, or for communication- and sometimes
for no reason other than artistic considerations. A
simple illusion can often express a complex idea, such
as when the memory of a location is triggered by the
illusory sound of a babbling brook that runs through
the place. A storytelling session conducted by a group of
forest gnomes is a riot of sounds and images that helps
give meaning and intensity to the tale being told. It is
a kind of entertainment unfathomable by most other
races, whose stories and performances are limited by
whatever materials are on hand.

The forest gnomes' playful nature shows through in
the illusions they create, even those that have a serious
purpose. (An illusion that conceals the entrance
to a tunnel by making it look like solid earth might not
amuse other folk, but the gnomes get a good laugh out
of it.) Forest gnomes spend their spare time experimenting
with the creation of never-before-seen illusions, or
embellishing the images and sounds they already know
how to produce.

The number of ways in which forest gnomes use illusions
to have fun is nearly limitless. A few examples: visual
enhancements to a mythic tale told by an elder, new
and interesting sounds, and false doors and hallways
to fool intruders and lead them into traps. (Goblins just
can't pass by a door that calls them names.)

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-deepGnomes">Deep Gnomes</a>

<img src='https://www.worldanvil.com/uploads/images/6bd6390db7215d10b9d594525eef6205.png' style='float:right;width:40%;padding:20px' />

Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are the pragmatic and often
grumpy cousins of the gnome family, who live deep
underground. The Underdark is full of danger, meaning
that deep gnomes spend much of their time simply staying
alive. They endure this life because the Underdark
also holds incredible treasures: minerals and gemstones,
gold, silver, and platinum. The svirfneblin mine
these materials whenever they find a new deposit.

The svirfneblin do take pleasure from success in these
mining operations. A thin smile emerges from the stonelike
features of a deep gnome who finds a truly remarkable
gem, and such a discovery lightens the mood in the
enclave for a time.

Deep gnomes do their best to remain hidden. Even if surface travelers succeed in locating a svirfneblin community, winning their trust can be even more difficult. Those rare travelers who do succeed in befriending deep gnomes find that they are loyal and courageous allies against any foe.

#### Master Miners
Despite their guarded natures, svirfneblin aren't joyless. They admire skillful work and delicate craftsmanship, just like any other gnome. Svirfneblin love gemstones of all kinds, and they boldly seek out precious stones in the deepest and darkest tunnels. They are also expert gemcutters and miners, and they prize rubies above all other gemstones.

#### Hidden but homey
Svirfneblin are known as deep gnomes because they choose to live far below the earth's surface. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day. Their homes are well-hidden strongholds concealed by mazelike passages and clever illusions. Vast networks of mine tunnels ring most svirfneblin settlements, guarded by deadly traps and concealed sentries.

Everything is designed to make the entrance to a settlement uninviting. But inside its borders, a deep gnome settlement is a warren shaped
and decorated by the svirfneblin to make the place welcoming
and comfortable.

Although they are skilled stonemasons, svirfneblin appreciate
the beauty of natural stone and prefer either to
carve to accentuate its features or to leave it unchanged.
Their architecture is marked by smooth, curving shapes
rather than straight lines and hard edges.

Svirfneblin are intensely community-minded and have
little concern about privacy among themselves. Thus,
they don't close off living spaces with doors or window
coverings. Most of their homes are sparsely furnished
dwellings of one or two rooms. Bed spaces, often carved
into the cavern walls, are strung with hammocks for
each inhabitant, but often are otherwise empty except
for stone coffers holding a few personal effects.



#### Scouts and Spies
Surface-dwelling gnomes often take up the adventurer's life out of sheer curiosity about the world around them, eager to see new things and meet new people. By comparison, most svirfneblin possess very little wanderlust and rarely travel far from home. They see the surface world as a bewildering place without boundaries and filled with unknown dangers.

Nevertheless, a few svirfneblin understand that it is necessary to know something about what is happening on the surface near their hidden refuges. As a result, some svirfneblin become scouts, spies, or messengers who venture abroad, doing their best to avoid attention. These travelers are notoriously close-mouthed about where they come from and what they are up to, but a few eventually learn to trust good-hearted people of the surface world.

A few svirfneblin become merchants who deal with other races both above and below ground. Drow, duergar, and other peoples know that svirfneblin are usually neutral in outlook and typically honest in their dealings. Serving as middlemen between races too hostile to deal with each other directly can be lucrative, and it serves an important defensive function; svirfneblin middlemen tend to know more about rumors and threats between rival merchants than anybody else.


## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-gnomeGods">Gnome Gods</a>
> *"Who forged the chains that bind Tiamat in Avernus? Why do the modrons go on the Great March? Who is the Lady of Pain, really? I can't tell you. but the answers lie in the Colden Hills. And if Carl and his gang don't know, it can't be known."*
>
> -- Griballix, gnome of Sigil

It shouldn't be surprising that gnomes, inveterate inventors
that they are, have an incredible number of legends
they tell about their deities. Every warren has its unique
repertoire of tales -some of them no doubt grounded
in fact, while others could be the products of imagination.
The distinction isn't important to the folk who take
inspiration and pride from the stories of their gods, because
each legend is true in its own way.

Each deity in the gnome pantheon is an expert in
multiple fields of activity who is capable of incredible
feats. Yet these heroes also display shortcomings, such
as hesitance or selfishness. Only the chief gnome deity,
Garl Glittergold, can convince the others to set aside
personal concerns to embark on a grand excursion or to
work together toward a common goal. And according to
the gnomes, it is proven that their gods can accomplish
the impossible when they band together.

Perhaps because of each community's particular outlook
or because the gods frequently use illusory guises,
several diverse ideas exist about the membership of the
pantheon. In some communities, the gods are thought
to be all male or all female; in some they are animals, or
constructs made by Garl Glittergold. Some gnomes say
Garl has five allies, while others tally eleven.

A consensus of sorts emerges from the totality of
these beliefs. Most gnomes believe that Garl Glittergold
and his seven able assistants dwell on, in, or under
seven summits known as the Golden Hills. This is the
place from where new gnomish souls are sent out to
experience the wider world, and to which they return to
join the hallowed community of those who have come
before them. Urdlen is the only gnome deity that doesn't
dwell there, having been exiled by Garl for its refusal to
cooperate with the rest of the group.

The Gnome Deities table lists the members of the
gnome pantheon. For each god, the table notes alignment,
province (the god's main areas of interest and
responsibility), suggested domains for clerics who serve
the god, and a common symbol of the god. Several of the
gods in the table are described below.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-GarlGlittergold">Garl Glittergold</a></h4>

When gnome children hear their first stories about the
gods, they are introduced to a gold-skinned gnome with
a wide grin and glittering gemstone eyes that shift colors
like a kaleidoscope. The youngsters quickly learn
to recognize that their favorite character, the god of the
gnomes, is about to steal the show.

A joker and a prankster, Garl Glittergold reminds
gnomes that life is to be taken lightly, and that a good
laugh will serve them better than a grim attitude. When
Garl cavorts with mischief on his mind, Moradin's
beard might end up woven with giggling flowers, and
Gruumsh's axe could sprout braying donkey heads at
the most inopportune time.

**Cooperation Is Key**. The legends about Garl Glittergold
inspire gnomes to work together. Garl knows that
many heads and many hands make light work. Although
he also plays many pranks on his own, Garl is the one
who gathers the heroes together for an enterprise that
requires all their talents. To provide specific guidance,
Garl might send an omen to nudge a group of gnomes
in a certain direction, or even manifest an avatar in the
middle of a gnome burrow. When Garl makes one of
these rare appearances, it is to resolve a dispute that
threatens a community.


**Brains over Brawn**. Garl favors trickery and illusion
over direct combat, preferring to use his mind to overcome
a problem rather than his steel. For gnomes to
thrive, they must use their intellect and ingenuity. But
when push comes to shove, Garl uses Arumdina, his
intelligent two-headed battle axe -capable of cleaving
through any substance- to escape a perilous situation.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-BaervanWildwanderer">Baervan Wildwanderer</a></h4>

Baervan Wildwanderer is the god of the forests and of
those who travel, a peaceful soul whose explorations
often turn into exciting adventures. Baervan's constant
companion is Chiktikka Fastpaws, a mischievous giant
raccoon who often gets the duo into trouble. Although
Baervan isn't as much of a prankster as some of the
other gods, she is often held responsible when Chiktikka
does something outrageous, such as stealing Gruumsh's
breakfast or peeing on Rillifane Rallathil's shoes.

Baervan can sing every bird's song, knows every type
of plant that has ever grown, never gets lost, and can
befriend anyone under the sun (as long as Chiktikka
chooses to act pleasant rather than annoying). Forest
gnomes believe that they can speak to the animals of the
woods and in the air because Baervan teaches their
souls how to do so before they are born.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-BaravarCloakshadow">Baravar Cloakshadow</a></h4>

When gnomes arrived in the world, Baravar protected
them by teaching them how to hide, use magic, and deceive
their foes. She was once entrapped by the goblin
god Khurgorbaeyag, and after escaping and gaining her
revenge, she began the practice of never wearing the
same face twice, and she follows a different routine every
day so no one can predict what she might do. When
gnomes tell stories of their gods' adventures, Baravar is
always the last to be found when the group forms, but
she nevertheless swiftly agrees to support Garl's plans.

Forest gnomes and deep gnomes owe their innate
magical abilities to Baravar, and all gnomes get their
natural defense against magic from her shrewdness.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-CallarduranSmoothhands">Callarduran Smoothhands</a></h4>

Callarduran became the patron of the deep gnomes
when he led them into the Underdark and taught them
how to survive, but all gnomes see him as the embodiment
of the drive to know more, to examine everything
more minutely- and thereby make great discoveries.

Callarduran earned his moniker when, after stealing
the heart of Ogremoch, he rubbed his hands smooth
as he polished the heart and turned it into a magical
stone. The theft caused Ogremoch to turn to evil, but
it gave Callarduran the power to control earth elementals - which, it is said, he can confer to deep gnomes by rubbing the stone and saying their names.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-FlandalSteelskin">Flandal Steelskin</a></h4>

The stories that gnomes tell of Flandal Steelskin typically
feature some perfect item that he crafted or a
misadventure that results from following his enormous
nose, which can smell ore more easily than a wolf can
scent a skunk. The most often told legend of Flandal includes
both elements. Before creating Garl's marvelous
axe, Arumdina, Flandal sniffed out the purest source
of mithral: the heart of Imix. With the aid of the other
gnome gods, he stole the heart and turned it into a mithral
forge that now burns with an eternal furious flame.

The legends of Flandal portray him not only as the
god of metalcraft, but also of fire and glass-work and
alchemy. Rock gnomes attribute their knack for crafting
devices and alchemical objects to Flandal's superlative
skills in those areas.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-GaerdalIronhand">Gaerdal Ironhand</a></h4>

The Shield of the Golden Hills, Gaerdal Ironhand, has
no use for amusements, and she doesn't deign to smile
at any prank except those of Garl Glittergold. Gaerdal
obsesses about defense and vigilance, and she is an
expert in fortification, siege tactics, combat, and traps.

Instead of bustling about as gnome deities normally
do, Gaerdal has a tendency to dig in and hide out, and
in many tales Garl finds it difficult to convince her to
leave her home to join the others on adventures. Some
legends say this reluctance is due in part to an escapade
that cost her the loss of her hand. Flandal and Nebelun
worked together to replace it with a stronger one made
of iron, but her resentment over the mishap lingers.

Gnomes build their homes in hidden and defensible
places because Gaerdal teaches them these techniques.
Every secret door, spy hole, and intruder alarm in a
gnome warren is a tribute to Gaerdal's principles.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-Nebelun">Nebelun</a></h4>

Nebelun, also known as the Meddler, is fearless, perhaps
foolishly so. Every invention of Nebelun's starts
with a wild idea, nothing goes entirely according to plan,
and her greatest exploits often spring from mistakes.
Who else would stroll in and steal Semuanya's tail as
the lizard folk god splashed in his favorite pool? Who
else would use Thor's hammer to pound a nail and thus
be inspired to invent the lightning rod? Gari never needs
to persuade Nebelun to join an excursion, but he and
the rest of the pantheon do have to focus her attention
on the task at hand, so that her madcap inventiveness
doesn't derail the effort.

All gnomes see Nebelun as the delightful spirit of
invention and discovery, even those whose livelihoods
have nothing to do with the construction of odd devices.
Any accident that fortuitously results in a new discovery
might be credited to Nebelun's benevolent meddling in
the affairs of mortal gnomes.


<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-SegojanEarthcaller">Segojan Earthcaller</a></h4>

The gnomes know Segojan Earthcaller as a kind,
modest hero. He is said to be the best cook among the
gnome gods and to have the power to heal any sickness,
because he knows the medicinal and culinary uses of
every creature and plant that lives underground. During
the misadventures of the gnome pantheon, Segojan
contributes to the group through his healing abilities
and the restorative power of his meals, and on many
occasions the other gnome gods call upon him to use his
ability to burrow through any substance.

Forest gnomes believe that their ability to speak with
burrowing animals comes from Segojan. All gnomes
see Segojan as a healer of the sick and a protector of
the hearth. He is also revered in his role as a guide for
gnomish souls after death, as long as the body is buried
before worms claim it. If a gnome's body isn't entrusted
to Segojan by interring it, the soul is forced to find its
own way to the afterlife.

<h4><a class="internal-link" name="internal-Urdlen">Urdlen</a></h4>

Many pantheons include in their number a miscreant or
an outlier -someone not to be emulated in the customary
way, and often an entity whose existence serves as
an object lesson and an example of what befalls mortals
who conduct themselves the same way. For the gnomes,
this niche is filled by Urdlen, also known as the Glutton
for its selfish and cruel behavior.

Though the details differ from telling to telling, all
gnomes know the story of how Garl banished Urdlen
from the Golden Hills because Urdlen refused to go on
an important quest. Despite Garl's efforts and the pleas
of the rest of the pantheon, Urdlen selfishly refused to
set his own interests aside and contribute to the group.

Every version of this story ends in some sort of tragedy -perhaps the loss of Gaerdal's hand, the affliction
that caused Flandal to need new skin, or the disappearance
of Baravar's shadow- and each one concludes with
"And that is why Garl sent Urdlen into exile." In tales
of his later life, Urdlen is no longer a gnome but has
become a greedy and destructive monster, a great blind
and hairless mole with iron claws and teeth.

Gnomes believe that Urdlen exerts influence on their
lives when they experience jealousy, greed, petulance,
or envy. Individuals are more likely to fall prey to these
feelings when they don't spend enough time in activities
with others, and so tales of Urdlen serve as a somber
reminder of the importance of participating in society.



## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-gnomeAdventurers">Gnome Adventurers</a>
> *"I don't know how many times I've seen a gnome turn a dead end into a wonderful opportunity."*
>
> -- Delaan Winterhound

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/74/54/a874542df88299ccb37275d2de306a67.png' style='float:right;width:40%;padding:20px' />

When a gnome leaves the burrow, the force behind that
decision is almost always curiosity -an insatiable need
to seek out and experience what the world has to offer.

Sometimes the adventuring life is the natural outgrowth
of a gnome's research project or experiment. A rock
gnome alchemist who discovers a new form of fungus
growing in a nearby cavern might wander farther afield
from the burrow, looking for knowledge about other
fungi in the world. A forest gnome who hears about a
master illusionist in a faraway realm could embark on a
journey to find that person and learn new tricks. A rock
gnome artificer might become determined to locate any
deposits of a rare metal, willing to travel the world high
and low in search of it. Even a deep gnome might be
born with an irrepressible urge to leave the Underdark
and join a group to pursue a life of shared purpose.

Some gnome communities make a practice of sending
young adults away from the burrow as a rite of passage,
encouraging them to explore the realms of humans,
dwarves, and elves for a time, with instructions to bring
back information and new ideas for the community.

Most of these folk return to the burrow at the appointed
time or even sooner, their curiosity having been satisfied.
But a few of them take readily to life in the outside
world and don't come back on schedule, returning to the
burrow only after spending years or decades away as a
member of an adventuring party.


#### The pull of the stars
Because of their extensive travels, gnome adventurers
often become fascinated with the grandeur of the
cosmos as seen in the motion of the stars across the
sky. They view the cosmic array as a giant machine of
wonderful complexity -a banquet for a curious gnomish
mind. Many renowned astronomers, wizards, and
extraplanar travelers are gnomes, having undertaken
those disciplines in the hope of better understanding the
workings of the multiverse.

#### A gnome's role
Gnomes are valuable members of an adventuring party
for a number of reasons, derived from both their innate
abilities and their unique mind-set.

Possessed of higher intelligence than most other
races, a gnome can be an important source of knowledge,
and can devise solutions for many problems an
adventuring party encounters. A rock gnome rogue on
a dungeon expedition, if not lost in thought, can steer a
party clear of many obstacles. Even the most complex
magical or mechanical traps can be disarmed by a rock
gnome who takes pride in solving difficult puzzles.



A forest gnome's skills are invaluable in the wilderness.
Forest gnomes can spot subtle tracks, uncover
clues that others would miss, and locate the safest path.
Their illusion magic taunts, deludes, and terrifies enemies
at the same time it delights their friends.

Forest gnomes and rock gnomes also contribute to a
party by being a source of optimism and levity. Even in
the worst circumstances, a gnome can find something
to be hopeful for -an attitude that is infectious and thus
can keep the group from falling into despair.

A deep gnome, pragmatic and cautious, brings a sense
of duty rather than a sense of humor to an adventuring
group. With their grit and iron will, deep gnomes meet
adversity with hammers, picks, and their dour, dry wit -or
no wit at all- as their weapons of choice.








# <a class="internal-link" name="internal-tinkerKnight">Tinker Knight</a>
The inventive warriors known as Tinker Knights seek an unorthodox form of martial skill. Rather than hone their physical abilities with the armaments of war, they look to augment their mundane physical abilities with mechanical inventions and innovative weaponry.

Warriors adopt the archetype of the Tinker Knight for many reasons. Some have been grievously injured, and use their ingenuity to make up for their physical shortcomings. Others seek to put their sharp minds to use, but still desire to swing their sword and raise their shield on the front lines of the battlefield.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can take 10 minutes to adjust a number of objects equal to the number of schematics you know, modifying each object to gain the features of each schematic. To be eligible, an object must meet the requirements stated in the schematic description.



The modifications from each schematic last until the end of your next long rest, and an object can only be modified by one schematic at a time.

***Saving Throws***. If a schematic requires a saving throw, your Schematic save DC is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

### Tinker's Expertise
Your inventive skill has grown to rival the best of innovators. Items modified by your schematics count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities, and you can apply your schematics to magical weapons and armor.

A magic item cannot gain more than a +3 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, or AC through this feature.

### Mechanical Synergy
You have learned to make your modifications work together. You can now apply two of your schematics to one item as long as the item meets both prerequisites.

### Flexible Innovation
You have gained such a familiarity with your inventive arsenal that you can make adjustments in a relatively short amount of time. At the end of a short rest, you can remove the effects of one of your schematics from an item and apply the schematic to a different item that meets the prerequisites. If a schematic's effect has a limited amount of uses per day, the number of expended uses stays the same when transferred.

In addition, you can apply up to three schematics to one item if that item meets the prerequisites for each schematic.

### Masterwork Inventions
Your innovations to the armaments of war are beyond compare. Weapons modified by your schematics gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for each schematic applied to them. In the same vein, suits of armor modified by your schematics gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class for each schematic applied to them.

A weapon or suit of armor modified by your schematics cannot gain a bonus greater than +3, regardless of any innate bonuses the item may have had before being modified.








## Schematics
The following schematics are available to you when you learn a new schematic. If a schematic has a level requirement, you can learn it at the same time you meet the requirement.

#### Featherweight Schematic
You modify the metallurgical makeup of an item, making it lighter. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic, your movement speed increases by 5 feet.
 ***Heavy Armor***. When applied, the wearer ignores any Strength requirements the armor may have, or any penalty it imposes upon Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
 ***Light Armor***. When applied, the wearer can subtract up to 100 feet from their fall when calculating fall damage and can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot they fall.
 ***Weapon***. When applied, a Heavy weapon becomes normal weight, and a normal weapon becomes Light.

#### Intuitive Schematic
You modify an item to take advantage of your martial and investigative instincts. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic, you gain proficiency with the Investigation skill and have advantage on any Investigation checks you make
 ***Armor***. When applied, the wearer can use Intelligence in place of Dexterity, when calculating AC.
 ***Weapon***. When applied, the wielder can use Intelligence modifier in place of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

#### Radiant Schematic
You imbue an item with a source of radiant energy. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic, you can use a ***bonus action*** to cause the item to emit bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light 15 feet beyond that. You can extinguish the light as a ***bonus action*** on your turn.
 ***Armor or Weapon***. When you are hit by an attack (armor), or hit a creature with an attack (weapon), you can use your ***reaction*** to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

#### Rebounding Schematic
You modify an item so that it has elastic properties. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic, you can use your ***reaction*** to add your Intelligence modifier to AC against one attack.
 ***Armor***. When the wearer of this armor is hit by an attack, they can use their ***reaction*** to reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d12 + their Intelligence modifier. If they reduce the damage to 0, the attacker takes the full damage of the attack as if they had been the original target. Once you use this feature you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.



 ***Non-Heavy Weapon***. When applied, the weapon gains the thrown property with a range of 20 feet. After making an attack with this weapon, it immediately returns to the wielder.

#### Empowered Schematic
*Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight*

You modify this item with complex clockwork mechanics that improve your physical capability and hone your reflexes. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic, you gain a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.
 ***Heavy Armor***. When applied, the wearer can use their Intelligence score, in place of Strength, for any Strength ability checks or saving throws you make.
 ***Light Armor***. When applied, the wearer can use their Intelligence score, in place of Dexterity, for any Dexterity ability checks or saving throws they make.
 ***Weapon***. When applied, anytime you roll a 1 or 2 for a damage roll with this weapon, you can choose to re-roll the die, but you must use the new result even if it is a 1 or 2.

#### Resilient Schematic
*Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight*

You modify the metallurgical makeup of this item to make it far more resilient. While wearing or wielding an item modified by this schematic you have advantage on saving throws to resist being grappled or moved against your will.
 ***Armor***. When applied, this armor grants resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 ***Weapon***. When applied, this weapon deals bonus damage equal to your Intelligence modifier + your fighter level when you score a critical hit.

## Archetype Maneuvers
The following maneuvers are available only to a Tinker knight. Tinker knights focus on overcoming enemies and obstacles with the help of their mechanical inventions.

#### Feats of Mechanical Strength
When you make a Strength check or are forced to make a Strength saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to expend a superiority die to gain a bonus to your roll equal to your superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier.

#### Spring-Loaded Leap
When you make a high or long jump, you can expend a superiority die as part of your movement to increase your jump distance by a number of feet equal to two rolls of your superiority die.

#### Tinker's Insight
When you make an Investigation check, or a check with a set of artisan's tools in which you are proficient, you can expend a superiority die to gain a bonus to your roll equal to two rolls of your superiority die.








# <a class="internal-link" name="internal-trickster">Trickster Conclave</a>
Kobold rangers are regularly underestimated, but those in the Trickster conclave use that lack of esteem as both a defense and an offense, when need be. Using their cleverness and various talents, they create their own advantages in order to level the playing field.


#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Combat Trickster, Opportune Strike |
| 5th | Rabbit from a Hat |
| 7th | Out of Sight, Out of Reach, Combat Trickster (additional tricks, d8 damage) |
| 11th | Exploitative Nature |
| 15th | Elusive Foe, Combat Trickster (additional tricks) |


### Combat Trickster
Starting when you join this conclave, you learn how to use your ingenuity, deft hands, and the knowledge you've accumulated, to counteract that you are physically at a disadvantage to most foes. You gain proficiency with tinkerâ€™s tools if you don't have it already.

 **Combat Tricks**. The conclave has entrusted you with three blueprints and designs for combat tricks; items meant to hinder your enemies. The combat tricks are detailed at the end of the archetype description. You learn the design of one additional combat trick at 7th and 15th level.

 **Trick Capacity**. Using your tinker tools, you can spend a short rest crafting or repairing a combat trick. You can only carry four of these combat tricks at any given time. Your trick capacity increases by one at 7th level and 15th level.

 **Saving Throws**. Your combat tricks require creatures that trigger them to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Combat Trick DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice)

### Opportune Strike
You have leart how to exploit the openings your combat tricks create. When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can use a ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack against it. Additionally, you never trigger your own combat tricks unless you want to.

### Rabbit From a Hat
Your familiarity with the combat tricks you employ improves your handling of them. You can choose to use combat tricks as a ***bonus action***.



Additionally, when you craft or repair a combat trick, you can spend a spell slot to enchant it. An item enchanted in this way deals your choice of fire or poison damage when a creature fails its saving throw against it. The damage is 3d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st. If more than one combat trick is placed in the same area, a creature only takes damage from the most powerful of them. Regardless of whether the creature fails its saving throw or not, the magic imbued in the item is expended.

### Out of Sight, Out of Reach
You always have a plan to get out of a sticky situation. You can use a ***bonus action*** to take the Disengage action.

### Exploitative Nature
Your keen eye knows exactly which signs to look for, and how to exploit a show of weakness, no matter how slight it is. When you use a ***reaction*** to attack a creature because it failed a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can make two weapon attacks instead of one.

### Elusive Foe
You can use every opportunity to get out of dodge. When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can use your ***reaction*** to move up to half your speed.

## Combat tricks
Some of the items here are also in the Player's Handbook, but these versions are slightly improved, due to the time, effort, and talent poured into making them.

In addition to hindering your enemies in some way, some are also designed to harm. When combat tricks deal damage, they refer to your trick die, which starts out as d6, and at 7th level it becomes d8.

 **Ball bearings (bag of 1,000)**. As an ***action***, you can spill these tiny metal, glass, crystal, stone, or bone balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. The first Large or smaller creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, taking 1 trick die of bludgeoning damage.

 **Caltrops (bag of 20)**. As an ***action***, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. The first creature that enters the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 2 trick dice of piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed makes the saving throw with advantage.








 **Flash Rods (one pair)**. As an ***action***, you can place these two rods connected by a thin wire on a flat surface. The first creature that passes between the rods trips the wire, making the rods flare up in an intensely bright light. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the turn.

 **Oil Fountain**. As an ***action***, you can place this small metal cube attached to a pressure plate on the ground. The first creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be sprayed with a highly volatile substance. If the creature takes fire or lightning damage before the substance evaporates at the start of its next turn, it takes 1 trick die fire damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to withstand the shock of being lit on fire. If it fails, it must use its reaction to move its movement speed in a random direction.

 -- **Special**. An oil trap is harder to place  efficiently, so it can only be placed as an action, even with the Rabbit from a hat feature.

 **Portable Ice (bag of 50)**. As an ***action***, you can spread a single bag of these compressed ice pellets to cover a 5-foot-square area. The first creature that enters the area triggers the pellets, making them expand rapidly, forming a 20-feet tall ice pillar that immediately shatters. Any Large or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. Tiny creatures don't trigger the pellets.

 -- **Special**. You need access to water to craft these pellets, and they melt after 1 hour if in extreme heat.

 **Screeching Sirens (soundproof container)**. As an ***action***, you can place the brittle container on the ground. The first Small or larger creature that enters its 5-foot area causes the container to break, releasing the short-lived bugs inside it. The bugs are drawn to the nearest source of body heat, while emitting a high-pitched sound. Until the start of its next turn, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw in order to cast a spell with verbal components.

 --**Special**. You need access to bugs normally found in the wild to collect enough of them to be efficient, so the DM may rule that a city, dungeon or similar restricts how many, if any, you can craft.



 **Snap trap**. When you use your ***action*** to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1 trick die of piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 trick die of piercing damage to the trapped creature.

 -- **Special**. A snap trap is harder to place efficiently, so it can only be placed as an action, even with the Rabbit from a hat feature.

 **Sonic Sphere**. As an ***action***, you can place a small metal sphere on the ground. Highly sensitive to vibrations in the ground, the sphere will activate when the first creature enters its 5-foot area, creating a burst of thunderous sound, which can be heard 100 feet away. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2 trick dice thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

 **Sneezing Powder Pellets (bag of 10)**. As an ***action***, you spread a single bag of these hollow, lightweight husks filled with ground seeds to cover a 5-foot square. The first creature that enters the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 trick die of poison damage and spend its action sneezing violently.

 **Twitchers (bag of 40)**. As an ***action***, you use a single bag of these tiny metal rods holding trace amounts of lightning energy to cover two 5-foot-square areas. The first creature that enters an area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 trick die of lightning damage from the small current running through them. A creature that fails this saving throw has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn.
