# Aasimar
Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are humans descended from beings with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.

### Celestial Champions
Aasimar have a place in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their celestial ancestors expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.

Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.

### Hidden Wanderers
While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.

<img src='http://duralans-workbench.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-prelude/Alhrand.png' style='float:left;width:25%;padding:20px' />

When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.

### Aasimar Guides
An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.

The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.

A deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.

As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.

### Conflicted Souls
Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.

Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible.

### Aasimar Names
Aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture.

  | 4 | You feel sick to your stomach when you first come within 30 ft of a fiend. This gives you the poisoned condition, lasting 1 minute. You cannot be affected again for 10 minutes.
  | 5 | If you die, your body can never be reanimated as an undead creature.
  | 6 | Your tears are iridescent or glowing, and have the ability to cure disease. This functions as the *lesser restoration* spell. You can use this feature once per day.

  | 8 | If your body is placed on consecrated ground and prayers to your deity are recited continuously for 24 hours, you return to life as if by a *raise dead* spell. This ability works 1d4 times in your lifetime.

    When creating bombs you can add some of your essence in the form of your bodily fluids, such as saliva, to the concoctions. If you do, half the damage dealt with the bombs is radiant damage if are a protector Aasimar, and necrotic if you are a fallen Aasimar.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

    In addition you get the ***Language of the gods*** trait.

    <div class="feat">

    ## Language of the Gods
    As a ***bonus action***, you can issue inspiring chants or terrible challenges in the Celestial tongue.

    Choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier within 60 ft that can hear you. Each target has advantage or disadvantage (your choice) on the first attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of your next turn.

    You can give this oration a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    </div>

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cavalier
    Your mount shares your Celestial resistance trait.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cleric
    If you have the *light* cantrip, you can manifest it as a halo centered above your head. Once while manifesting this halo, you can choose to have advantage on a Charisma ability check. You regain the use of this ability after a long rest.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cursed
    A cursed Aasimar is in a constant struggle between his heritage and curse. While transformed, you can spend a transformation to gain an additional use of Radiant soul or Necrotic shroud.

    If cursed with the chosen archetype, this will aways come in the form of the Radiant soul trait. If you have another archetype, this will instead be the Necrotic shroud form.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Druid
    Non magical insects never bite or sting you unless magically compelled to do so, or if you attack them first.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Feyblood
    An Aasimar can not become a Feyblood. If your Fey heritage is stronger, you will be born a regular human instead.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Fighter
    A skilled fighter can easily defeat a ten times stronger, but unskilled brute. It is not how hard you hit, but the precision of your strikes.

    Select Strength or Dexterity. Whenever the Fighter class description mentions your ability modifier for this ability, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. This also applies to attack and damage rolls using this ability.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    In addition you have access to the <a href="../Classes/fighter.html#internal-celestialKnight">Celestial Knight</a> archetype.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Inquisitor
    You have the might of Mount Celestia behind you as an Inquisitor. While working for a common cause, you receive the power you deserve.

    Whenever the Inquisitor class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Paladin
    Fighting evil is in your blood and you will not easily be stopped. You must fail four death saves before dying.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Professional
    An Aasimar is still also a human, and as such, good at adapting their knowledge and skills to whatever obstacle they face.

    Whenever the Professional class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Ranger
    Just as human, the Aasimar ranger is ready for anything that he might face in nature, and if by chance he would not be, he adapts and survives.

    Whenever the Ranger class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Rogue
    Because of their connection to Mount Celestia, Aasimar have a tendency to be drawn towards the lawful direction. This coupled with their tendency to face foes directly generally makes them not suitable as rogues.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Sorcerer
    You can spend a sorcery point to consecrate a spell that deals fire damage. If you do, half of the fire damage is instead radiant damage.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Swashbuckler
    An Aasimars natural charisma and human heritage make them well suited to swashbuckling.

    Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Warlock
    Aasimar consider themselves already beholden to a patron, the celestial being which is their heritage, so making a pact with another, potentially evil being, is out of the question. Fallen Aasimar on the other hand is a whole other thing, where a potential patron might even be the reason that the Aasimar is fallen in the first place.

    Protector Aasimar cannot be Warlocks.

    If you are a fallen Aasimar, whenever the Warlock class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. In addition, you learn an additional cantrip.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Wizard
    Whenever the Wizard class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. You may only do this if you are literate.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">
