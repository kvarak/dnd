# Aasimar
Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are humans descended from beings with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.

### Celestial Champions
Aasimar have a place in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their celestial ancestors expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.

Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.

### Hidden Wanderers
While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.

<img src='http://duralans-workbench.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-prelude/Alhrand.png' style='float:left;width:25%;padding:20px' />

When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.

### Aasimar Guides
An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.

The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.

A deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.

As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.

### Conflicted Souls
Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.

Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible.

### Aasimar Names
Aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture.

While transformed, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell.

- ### Cursed
    A cursed Aasimar is in a constant struggle between his heritage and curse. While transformed, you can spend a transformation to gain an additional use of Radiant soul or Necrotic shroud.

    If cursed with the chosen archetype, this will aways come in the form of the Radiant soul trait. If you have another archetype, this will instead be the Necrotic shroud form.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Druid
    Non magical insects never bite or sting you unless magically compelled to do so, or if you attack them first.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Feyblood
    An Aasimar can not become a Feyblood. If your Fey heritage is stronger, you will be born a regular human instead.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Fighter
    A skilled fighter can easily defeat a ten times stronger, but unskilled brute. It is not how hard you hit, but the precision of your strikes.

    Select Strength or Dexterity. Whenever the Fighter class description mentions your ability modifier for this ability, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. This also applies to attack and damage rolls using this ability.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    In addition you have access to the <a href="#internal-celestialKnight">Celestial Knight</a> archetype.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Inquisitor
    You have the might of Mount Celestia behind you as an Inquisitor. While working for a common cause, you receive the power you deserve.

    Whenever the Inquisitor class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Paladin
    Fighting evil is in your blood and you will not easily be stopped. You must fail four death saves before dying.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Professional
    An Aasimar is still also a human, and as such, good at adapting their knowledge and skills to whatever obstacle they face.

    Whenever the Professional class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Ranger
    Just as human, the Aasimar ranger is ready for anything that he might face in nature, and if by chance he would not be, he adapts and survives.

    Whenever the Ranger class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking.

    You make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Rogue
    Because of their connection to Mount Celestia, Aasimar have a tendency to be drawn towards the lawful direction. This coupled with their tendency to face foes directly generally makes them not suitable as rogues.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Sorcerer
    You can spend a sorcery point to consecrate a spell that deals fire damage. If you do, half of the fire damage is instead radiant damage.

- ### Swashbuckler
    An Aasimars natural charisma and human heritage make them well suited to swashbuckling.

    Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Warlock
    Aasimar consider themselves already beholden to a patron, the celestial being which is their heritage, so making a pact with another, potentially evil being, is out of the question. Fallen Aasimar on the other hand is a whole other thing, where a potential patron might even be the reason that the Aasimar is fallen in the first place.

    Protector Aasimar cannot be Warlocks.

    If you are a fallen Aasimar, whenever the Warlock class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. In addition, you learn an additional cantrip.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Wizard
    Whenever the Wizard class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. You may only do this if you are literate.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-celestialKnight">Celestial Knight (Fighter Archetype)</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Divine Aura
| 7th | Celestial Presence
| 10th | Manifest Divinity
| 15th | Sight Beyond Sight
| 18th | Ascendent

</div>

Among the Aasimar there is a general belief that their ancestors may have left the seeds of celestial power in the material plane for a reason. Most of the time this presents itself as an overwhelming want to prove themselves through divine service.

Not all Aasimar follow this path however: some shirk the responsibilities of divine service or the taking of oaths. Perhaps not wanting to bind themselves in the service of an ancestor, they draw forth their hidden potential and search for other challenges that are fitting of a divine child.

**Restriction**: The Celestial Knight can only be taken by a character who is Aasimar.

#### Divine Aura
Starting at 3rd level, you become a beacon of hope for those who stalwartly defend the material plane against fiendish incursions. You can temporarily manifest a halo as a ***bonus action***; a corona of energy that varies in appearance depending on which type of Aasimar you are; a golden ring of light for Protector or a quivering ring of shadow for Fallen.

It lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it or are incapacitated. Whilst the halo is active, you gain the following benefits:

- If you are a **Protector** Aasimar, you shed bright light out to 10 ft and dim light an additional 10 ft. If you are a **Fallen** Aasimar, any bright light within 5 ft becomes dim light and any dim light becomes darkness.
- When you attack a creature with a weapon, you can use your ***reaction*** to give yourself advantage.
- If a fiend with a challenge rating equal to or less than half your fighter level starts or ends it’s turn within 10 ft of you, it must roll a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. If it fails it is frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of it’s turns, provided that it is not within 10 ft of you, and ends this effect on itself on a success.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses after a long rest.


#### Celestial Presence
By 7th level, your celestial heritage has begun to more directly influence your physical appearance. Your type determines what these changes are:

If you are a **Protector**, you begin to look elegant and perfect, and your skin and hair are constantly free of any dirt or blemishes. You have advantage on Charisma checks, as you enthrall those who look upon you.

If you are a **Fallen**, your dreadful aspect becomes so vivid that creatures now find your simple presence terrifying. Fear effects from your ***Divine Aura*** and ***Necrotic Shroud*** are enhanced, causing creatures to have disadvantage on their saving throws against them.

#### Manifest Divinity
Beginning at 10th level, you learn to harness your innate powers in a more focused manner, allowing you to take on your true appearance for longer.

Whenever you use your ***Divine Aura*** feature, you also gain the benefits of your natural transformation using radiant soul or necrotic shroud. However, any damage dealt by those abilities is halved for the duration of the divine aura.

#### Sight Beyond Sight
Starting at 15th level, your eyes become pools of energy that allow you to see the truth of the world.

You can see in non-magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions an succeed on saving throws against them, perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic, and see into the ethereal plane, all within a range of 30 feet.

#### Ascendent
At 18th level, you have realised the full potential of your celestial heritage. You can now activate your ***Divine Aura*** at will, and it lasts indefinitely unless you choose to end it. In addition, your divine aura has become much more powerful. Whilst your divine aura is active, the following changes apply:
- The light or darkness radiated your halo increases by an additional 10 feet.
- If you are a ***Protector*** Aasimar, the vision granted by your ***Sight Beyond Sight*** feature increases to 60 feet.
- If you are a **Fallen** Aasimar, as an ***action*** you can cause the fear effect of your transformation to activate, and the range increases to 20 feet. In addition, once per short rest, if you have not yet moved, you can teleport to an area of dim light or darkness that you can see within 300 feet of you. If you use this feature, your speed is 0 for the remainder of that turn.
