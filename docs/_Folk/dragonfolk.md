*Dragonfolk include the proud dragonborn, and the puny kobolds.*

# <a class="internal-link" name="internal-dragonborn">Dragonborn</a>
Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

#### Proud Dragon Kin
Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance.

<img src='../assets/images/dragonborn.png' style='float:left;width:35%;padding:20px' />

Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

#### Self-Sufficient Clans
To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.

#### Dragonborn Names
Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.

<div class="columnsthree">

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-DragonbornTraits">Dragonborn Traits</a>

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Ability Scores**. Your Strength ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2.

- **Age**. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

- **Alignment**. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.

- **Languages**. You understand Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

- **Size**. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed**. Your base speed is 30 feet.

</div>


### Draconic Ancestry

Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table (or roll randomly). Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Draconic Ancestry
    | 1d10 | Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Weapon |
    |:--:|:-------|:------------|:--------------|
    | 1 | Black | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
    | 2 | Blue | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
    | 3 | Brass | Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
    | 4 | Bronze | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
    | 5 | Copper | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
    | 6 | Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
    | 7 | Green | Poison | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)
    | 8 | Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
    | 9 | Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)
    | 10 | White | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)

- **Breath Weapon**. You can use your ***action*** to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

    When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

    After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short rest.

    **Damage Resistance**. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

    **Varied Lineage**. You may select a dragonborn exclusive feat, described later in this document.

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-DragonbornClassOptions">Dragonborn Class Options</a>

Dragonfolk approach some classes is a bit differently than other folk. When you select a class, it is modified as follows.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### Alchemist
    Most dragonfolk never even come into contact with the alchemical crafts unless they live in or near a human city. However, those who have, and chosen this as their lifetime goal usually turn out to be excellent alchemists.

    Whenever the Alchemist class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Barbarian
    Raging dragonfolk often give in completely to their draconic rage. While raging, you can bite, rip and tear as if you had a natural weapon dealing 1d4 piercing or slashing damage. If attacking only with natural weapons while raging, you may make an additional attack using a ***bonus action*** as if wielding an off-hand weapon.

    In addition, while raging, you can spend 10 Fury to use your breath weapon without spending its use. If you do, add your rage damage bonus to the damage it deals.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Bard
    Bards are a poor fit for dragonfolk for two main reasons. First, the bard *class* is very much jack of all trades, while dragonborn sees it as very important to be focused on one thing. Second, the bard *profession* is seen as mostly useless, with no practical use.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cavalier
    Dragonfolk do not usually become cavaliers. Mounts are often not comfortable with dragons on their backs. However, there are dragonriders, who ride drakes into battle. (Not suitable for player characters.)

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cleric
    Dragonfolk sees it as a weakness to rely on the gods. There are clerics in dragonfolk clans, but their role is not so much religious, as it is to keep the traditions, stories and laws.

    If you are a Cleric following Bahamut or Tiamat (and one of their domains), whenever the Cleric class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cursed
    Dragonfolk cannot become lycanthropes.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Druid
    Druids are uncommon among dragonfolk. Why would anyone want to change their form when it is perfect already?

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Feyblood
    You can select to be one of the rare faerie dragons. You make this choice at level 1 and cannot change this later.

    **The Colors of Age**. A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow.

    | Color | Age |
    |:------|:----|
    | Red | 5 years or less
    | Orange | 6–10 years
    | Yellow | 11–20 years
    | Green | 21–30 years
    | Blue | 31–40 years
    | Indigo | 41–50 years
    | Violet | 51 years or more

    **Euphoria breath.** Your breath weapon changes to a 15 ft cone of gas. Creatures within the cloud must succeed at a Wisdom save, or be *confused* for one minute. They get a new save at the end of each of their rounds.

    **Innate Spellcasting**. You can add both *dancing lights* and *minor illusion* to your cantrips to your spells known.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Fighter
    The natural traits of dragonfolk, such as thick scales or draconic ferocity, makes them fearsome fighters.

    Whenever the Fighter class description mentions your Strength modifier you may instead use your proficiency bonus. This also applies to attack and damage rolls using this ability.

    In addition, you may use your proficiency bonus instead of abiliy modifier when calculating AC and initiative.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Inquisitor
    Dragonfolk do not put much value in religion, so the inquisitor role is mostly non existant. The only time you would see a dragonfolk inquisitor would be if the individual was raised by humans.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Paladin
    Paladins are embodiments of the heroic ideals for their race. As the most common race that becomes paladins are humans, the archetypical behaviour of paladins is the ideal for humans.

    This often confuses people when they first meet a dragonfolk paladin, as they follow the ideals of their race, which might be similar, but can also be completely different from humans.

    If you are a Paladin devoted to the ideals of Bahamut, then whenever the Paladin class description mentions your Strength or Charisma modifier, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. This also applies to attack and damage rolls.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Professional
    Dragonfolk are well suited to be professionals as they have a natural desire for self-improvement and excellence in a narrow field. However, generally dragonfolk tend to prefer and value the more practical fields, like the candlemaker, cook, smith or forester.

    If belonging to a more practical field, whenever the Professional class description mentions your Wisdom modifier, you may instead use this modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Ranger
    The ranger is the epitome of self-sufficiency.

    Whenever the Ranger class description mentions your Wisdom modifier you may instead your proficiency bonus. In addition, you may use the same modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking (attack and damage). Make this choice at level 1 and it cannot be changed later.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Rogue
    Dragonfolk are really not built for stealth and subterfuge. However, sometimes the dragons' famed lust for gold endures in a dragonborn, who suffer the inescapable allure of treasure.

    When you become a 1st level rogue, you can select to gain the following package of traits:

    <div class="descriptive">

    **Hoard-Keeper**. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *alarm* spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *locate object* spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br>

    **Treasure Sense**. You can supernaturally sense gold, gems, and other treasures within 30 ft and through most barriers, but your senses are blocked by 1 ft of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead or 3 ft of wood or dirt. You can use this trait to detect the presence of magical items, but not identify them or their abilities.<br/>

    **Flaw**. My greed for gold and gemstones has a nearly religious fervor.

    </div>

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Sorcerer
    Sorcerers are just as rare and varied as within other races.

    Whenever the Sorcerer class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Swashbuckler
    Even though dragonfolk might seem unlikely to become swashbucklers, they do appreciate the skill required to survive combat without armor. Dragonfolk that choose to take the path of swashbuckling tend to more clever than calculating.

    Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Warlock
    Taking shortcuts to power is not the way of dragonfolk. However, some tribes do swear fealty to their dragon kin.

    If you are a Warlock with an ancient dragon patron, then whenever the Warlock class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Wizard
    Dragonfolk see the wizard as any other professional, and approach it with the same focus as they would any other life goal.

    Whenever the Wizard class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus. You may only do this if you are literate.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-kobold">Kobold</a></h1>

Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations. Kobold are short in stature, despite the draconic blood running in their veins, with the tallest of them barely reaching 3 feet and weighing no more than 35 pounds. Because of their small size, kobold often have to adopt unorthodox means of achieving victory. This usually leads to traps, which kobold are well known for crafting.

Unlike the true dragons they worship, kobolds don't have set colors that reflect certain personality traits. Whole tribes usually are the same one or two colors, and the color of a kobold has no bearing on its abilities or skill set. Kobolds display many of the traits that true dragons display, and are often either proud, or vain (or both).

> *“Kobolds are a lot less cute when they learn to cast fireballs."*
>
> -- Volo

A kobold can be fooled with smooth words or a quick wit, but when the kobold figures out it has been tricked, it remembers the affront. And when possible will retaliate against that person somehow, even if merely in a petty way. Though they are far less grudgeful against draconic races, feeling that they act so because they must prove their worth.

<img src='../assets/images/kobold.png' style='float:left;width:35%;padding:20px' />

#### A small package of greatness
Due to their small size, many kobold often feel that there's safety in numbers. As such they rarely strike out on their own, unless it's a mission of great importance or they are serving or proving themselves to a dragon.

While kobolds prefer to run away from a fight, they know that there is greatness within them and are proud that they were chosen to be the blood-kin of dragons. Despite this, a typical kobold acknowledges its weakness in the face of a hostile world. However, a kobold finds satisfaction in its work, the survival of its tribe, and the knowledge that it shares a heritage with mighty dragons.

#### Worship of dragons
Kobolds are renowned for their worship of dragons, in which case they cast aside any pride they have and willingly and proudly serve such mighty creatures without a thought of treason. If the dragon expresses cruelty, they will tolerate it or simply go away instead of seeking revenge. They even display actual acts of courage while within their service. Strangely, they have the same sentiment towards dragonborn and half dragons, whom they consider to be dragons.

This often leads to the annoyance of dragonborn, many of whom hold resentment towards dragons for past slavery. However, their obsessive loyalty and devotion, and their skill at handling the sewage of draconic communities, causes the other draconic races to tolerate their presence. And those that are able to put their pride aside acknowledge that more than one draconic community has been saved by using the kobolds overwhelming numbers and unorthodox way of fighting.

#### Natural miners
Kobolds are naturally skilled at tunneling. Similar to dwarves, they have a near-instinctive sense of what sections of stone or earth are strong or weak, are bearing a load or are safe to excavate, or are likely to contain minerals or offer access to water. This ability enables them to fashion secure homes in places where other creatures wouldn't feel safe.

Kobolds take advantage of their size by creating small-diameter tunnels that they can easily pass through, but that require larger creatures to hunch or even crawl to make progress.

#### Kobold Names
Kobold names are derived from the Draconic tongue and usually relate to a characteristic of the owner, such as scale colour, distinctive body parts, or typical behavior. For example, "Red Foot, "White Claw" and "Scurry" are Common translations of often-used names. A kobold might change its name when it becomes an adult, or add additional words and syllables after important events such as completing its first hunt, laying its first egg, or surviving its first battle.

Because kobolds can change sex to suit a tribe's needs, they don't differentiate between male or female names.

**Kobold Names**: Arix, Eks, Galax, Garu, Hagnar, Hox, Irtos, Kashak, Meepo, Molo, Ohsoss, Rotom, Sagin, Sik, Sniv, Taklak, Tes, Urak, Varn.

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-KoboldClassOptions">Kobold Class Options</a>

Kobolds approach some classes is a bit differently than other folk. When you select a class, it is modified as follows.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### Alchemist
    Kobolds are clever and cunning, and have a natural aptitude towards the practical appliations of alchemy.

    Whenever the Alchemist class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Barbarian
    Kobolds may be small and weak, but when cornered, they defend themselves in a flurry of draconic rage, biting and tearing with furious rage.

    While raging, you can bite, rip and tear as if you had finesse natural weapons dealing 1d4 piercing or slashing damage. If attacking only with natural weapons while raging, you can make an additional attack when you take the Attack action. Additionally you may make an attack using a ***bonus action*** as if wielding an off-hand weapon.

    You can add your rage damage bonus to both Strength and Dexterity attacks.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Bard
    Kobolds only use very primitive instruments, so the kobold bards mostly play some type of drum, or sing. However, their singing sounds terrible to most people, similar to cats in heat.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cavalier
    The cavalier class is more common than one would think among the kobolds. They are often seen riding on large lizards or drakes.

    Whenever the Cavalier class description mentions your Strength or Charisma modifier, you may instead use that modifier +3 or your proficiency bonus, whichever is lower. This also applies to attack and damage rolls.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cleric
    Kobolds worship dragons as their gods. This means that the cleric class does not exist, as there is no divine power to grant spells and powers. Instead the religious role of cleric is filled with sorcerers and warlocks who believe their power is granted by their dragon "gods".

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Cursed
    Dragonfolk cannot become lycanthropes.

    You may choose Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability instead of Intelligence.

    </div>

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Inquisitor
    The religious practices of kobolds mostly ignore things outside their own communities, so the inquisitor role does not really exist.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- ### Paladin
    Paladins are very rare but they do exist among the kobold, and are then embodiments of the heroic ideals for their race. This often confuses people when they first meet a kobold paladin, as they expect a paladin to follow the human ideals.

    In addition you can add the fighting style from the fighter entry to your selection of fighting styles.

    In addition, when using sneak attack, you can opt not to use all your sneak attack dice. For each die you did not use, you gain a +1 to AC until the start of your next turn. Note that you can sneak attack using 0 extra damage dice.

- ### Warlock
    Being small and weak as they are, kobolds would do anything to get ahead. They often do not have any problem following whatever creature that promises them power. The problem is, they are not often offered.

    A kobold gaining the favor of an Ancient dragon would be the highest honor of all, and such a person often ends up as chieftain or religious leader of their tribe.

    If you are a Warlock with an ancient dragon patron, then whenever the Warlock class description mentions your Charisma modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.
