# Genasi

Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals. The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time.

The powerful genies, however, don't face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito. During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie's eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal–genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.



Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.

#### Heirs to Elemental Power
Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.

Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).

Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all. Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.

#### Wild and Confident
Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.  Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi's sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.

#### Genasi Lands
As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi do not have communities of their own and adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.

Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.

#### Genasi Names
Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.

    <div class="feat">

    ## Me Fit Better
    *Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Chain*

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

</div>





<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-air">Air Genasi</a></h1>

As changeable as the weather, an air genasi's moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long. Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh. They are also known as Sylphs.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Ability Scores**. Your Dexterity ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2.

- **Unending Breath**. You can hold your breath indefinitely while you're not incapacitated.

- **Mingle with the Wind**. You know the *air mastery* cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast it once with this trait as if you had a 1st level spell slot, requiring no material components. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

</div>

### Air Genasi Class Options
Air genasi approach some classes a bit differently than other folk. In addition to the common genasi class options, classes are changed as follows:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Druid
    The ever-changing patterns of weather seem simple to you, due to your deep connection to the skies. Over the course of 1 minute, you can meditate to find out the following information about your local region:

    Current temperature and approximate wind speed.

    Weather for the next 8 hours.

    General trend of the season (drier, wetter, warmer, colder).

    Whether or not any outside force has acted on the weather in the past 24 hours.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- #### Swashbuckler
    The fluidity and grace of air genasi makes them ideal swashbucklers. Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

    <hr class="dividerinfolk">

- #### Warlock
    As an air genasi warlock, you have access to the following eldritch invocations:

    <div class="feat">

    ## Breezy Embrace
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

</div>






## <a name="internal-earth">Earth Genasi</a>
As an earth genasi, you have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action. An earth genasi is also known as an Oread.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates.

Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most eye-catching have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

 **Ability Scores**. Your Strength ability score, both current and maximum, increases by 2.

 **Earth Walk**. You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.

 **One with the Earth**. You know the *mold earth* cantrip.

#### Optional traits
Your form is extreme, even for an earth genasi. At character creation, you may choose one of these traits:

 **Crystalline Form**. You have a high amount of crystals in your skin. This allows you to use you ***reaction*** to gain advantage on saves against any light-based attack or give disadvantage on a target attacking you with a ray or light-based attack. However, all you Stealth checks are at a disadvantage due to light reflecting in your skin.

 **Granite Skin**. You have a rocky exterior granting you an AC of 14 + Dexterity modifier when wearing no armor. You can still use a shield and get the benefit. However, your speed is reduced to 20 feet and you weight is doubled.

 **Iron Skin**. You exterior is a thin layer of iron. You can use the *blade ward* cantrip, but you are vulnerable to lightning damage and you are affected by magnets.



### Earth Genasi Class Options
Earth genasi approach some classes a bit differently than other folk. In addition to the common genasi class options, classes are changed as follows:

#### Barbarian
You have access to the <a href="#internal-quakeBringer">Path of the Quake bringer</a>.

In addition, you gain the following ability at level 1:

<div class="feat">

## Tremor strike
You may strike the ground to cause a small tremor in an area 10 ft around you. Make one unarmed attack and apply it to each target in the area. The ground becomes difficult terrain.

When you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until after a short rest.


#### Sorcerer
You can almost communicate with metal and bend it to your will. As a ritual, you can cast the *mending* spell, affecting only metal objects.

#### Warlock
As an earth genasi warlock, you have access to the following eldritch invocation:

<div class="feat">

## Earth Glide
*Prerequisite: 15th level*

As an ***action***, you can connect with the ground beneath your feet. For 1 minute, you can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone.

You can’t take this action again until you finish a long rest.


### Earth Genasi Feats

<div class="feat">

## Artisan's Eye
The treasure seekers of the dao echo in your heritage, allowing you an innate knack for identifying precious items.
- Increase your **Intelligence** or **Wisdom** by 1.
- You have advantage on any check made to determine the quality, rarity, or legitimacy of precious gems or metals, or objects made with them.
- You also can cast the *detect magic* spell at will, but it only detects magic items and objects, not spells.









## <a name="internal-fire">Fire genasi</a>
As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the fiery efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it. Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone. They are also known as Ifrit.

 **Fire Resistance**. You have resistance to fire damage.

 **Reach to the Blaze**. You know the *control flames* cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.



### Fire Genasi Class Options
Fire genasi approach some classes a bit differently than other folk. In addition to the common genasi class options, classes are changed as follows:

#### Barbarian
Your rage appears as a visible, fiery aura around you, and your bonus rage damage deals magical fire damage.

#### Fighter
If you take fire damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to activate your Second Wind ability. Used this way, you heal additional damage equal to your class level.

<!--
* **Monk**. You gain the following ability at 2nd level:

<div class='descriptive'>
**Brazen Flame**. You can infuse your natural weapons with your inner flame. You can spend 1 ki as a bonus action, to add fire damage to all your unarmed attacks this round. This extra damage is equal to your martial arts die.
</div>
-->

<div class="feat">

## Localized Inferno
*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can cast *wall of fire* without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation again.









## <a name="internal-water">Water genasi</a>
The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths; all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams. They are also known as Undines.

 **Amphibious**. You can breathe air and water.

 **Swim**. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

 **Call to the Wave**. You know the *shape water* cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Water Genasi Class Options
Water genasi approach some classes a bit differently than other folk. In addition to the common genasi class options, classes are changed as follows:

#### Alchemist
Alchemy is mostly about mixing liquids, which comes naturally to you. Whenever the Alchemist class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

#### Barbarian
As a ***bonus action*** you can heal 2 hp, as long as you are submerged completely within a body of natural water. Stagnant, poisoned, or trapped water (such as an artificial pit) does not activate this ability. You can heal up to 2 hp per level, after which you have to finish a long rest to use the ability again.

#### Ranger
You can sense vibrations in water, gaining blindsense 30 ft against creatures in contact with the same body of water.



#### Sorcerer
Your fire spells are imbued with elemental water, causing them to manifest as superheated steam. The altered spell works normally underwater. Unlike fire, the steam cannot ignite objects or set creatures on fire. As the spell still deals fire damage, fire resistance or immunity still applies to the spell's effects.

#### Swashbuckler
The fluidity and grace of water genasi makes them ideal swashbucklers. Whenever the Swashbuckler class description mentions your Intelligence modifier, you may instead use your proficiency bonus.

#### Warlock
As an water genasi warlock, you have access to the following eldritch invocation:

<div class="feat">

## Master of the Waves
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can cast *water walk* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.


### Water Genasi Feats
A water genasi has access to the following feats:

<div class="feat">

## Eternal purity
The purity of the elemental plane of water flows through your veins.

- Increase your **Constitution** score by 1.
- You have advantage on saves against poison.
- You have resistance to posion damage.
- You can drink any manner of water, so long as it is of an appropriate temperature. This includes sea water, thin mud, and other such liquids; you still gain the benefits of drinking normal water.









# <a name="internal-quakeBringer">Path of the Quake Bringer</a>
To match the grand fury and power of an earthquake or avalanche, barbarians of the Path of the Quake Bringer channel primal power, drawing on the element of earth when they rage to turn their body to stone. These warriors test their strength by smashing boulders and leaping chasms. In battle, they embody the earthquake itself, leaving craters, rubble, and terror in their rumbling wake.

Quake bringers often come from cultures connected to the earth (especially if they value strength) such as those of dwarves, goliath, or firbolgs. Earth genasi can manifest these abilities using latent elemental power. Some quake bringers communed with earth spirits or spent years in isolation on a mountain to gain power.


#### Path Features
| Barbarian Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Earthen
| 3rd | Stone Rage
| 6th | Demolisher
| 10th | Cliff Running
| 14th | Seismic Smash


### Earthen
You cannot be petrified, and when you are pushed or pulled, you can reduce the distance you are moved by up to 5 feet.

### Stone Rage
Your rage armors you with rumbling stone. You gain the following benefits while raging.
* At the start of each of your turns and when you start raging, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 + half your barbarian level. They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.
* You can use a ***bonus action*** to shake the ground within 5 feet of you. It becomes difficult terrain for other creatures until the start of your next turn.

### Demolisher
Your elemental power focuses into mighty blows that smash even stone. You deal double damage with melee weapon attacks to objects and structures. When you hit a target composed of earth (dirt, crystal stone, metal etc.) with a melee weapon attack, your weapon is treated as if it were magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance, and if the target is an object or structure, you also gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to half your barbarian level

Also, you have advantage on Strength checks made to dig, demolish, or excavate using a tool or object.



### Cliff Running
Starting at 10th leveL you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You don't need free hands to use this speed unless you are climbing a surface that isn't made of some kind of earth.

In addition, when you jump off of a surface made of earth, you draw power from the earth to boost your leap, increasing your high jump distance by a number of feet equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1) and your long jump distance by twice that amount.
Finally, you have tremorsense that extends out to a radius of 60 feet while you are raging, allowing you to sense through the earth.

### Seismic Smash
You gain the ability to smash the ground itself and create a great seismic shockwave. As an ***action*** while raging and wielding a melee weapon, you can strike the ground with this power. Each other creature on the ground within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). You can choose to use a smaller radius, if desired.

On a failed saving throw, a target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your barbarian level + your Strength modifier and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared Each 5-foot radius portion requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand. When you use this ability, you can choose to damage the ground in the area, structures in contact with the ground in the area, both, or neither. This ability deals twice as much damage to those objects.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.
