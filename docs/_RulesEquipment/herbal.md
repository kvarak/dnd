    Benefit: Any character inhaling the smoke (whether from tobacco or incense) gains an advantage against any fear related saves while it is burning (no more than 1 hour) and for 1 hour afterwards. If outdoors, the smoke can affect a 5 ft radius if there is no wind. Incense will have no effect outdoors if there is any wind, while the tobacco would only affect the smoker. Indoors, the smoke of a single pipe or block of incense can affect a 10 ft radius. The character must inhale the smoke for at least 10 minutes to acquire its benefits.

    Price: 10 gp

-   #### Flayleaf

    Price: 8 sp

-   #### Geranium Compress

    Price: 4 sp

    The geranium compress is made from the leaves and flowers of the plant. After being steeped in oil for several weeks the oil is strained and a bit of blood spice is added.

If several doses are taken simultaneously, higher level spell slots can be regained, up to the number of doses taken. However, other memories linger uninvited to forever haunt and burden the user of this drug. Each dose inflicts 2d8 psychic damage after the initial effect.


-   #### Healing myrrh

    Price: 5 sp

    When you burn this powerful resin, it fills a small room with faint smoke that persists for a full hour. Any creatures resting in the area regain 1 additional hit point per level. Multiple uses of healing myrrh in a 24-hour period do not stack.


-   #### Healing poultice

    A healing poultice is a special mixture of herbs compacted into a bandage and then laid across a wound. It hardens and assists in the healing process, but requires time and rest. Once a healing poultice is applied, you heal at the end of your next short rest. You may apply this healing before you spend hit dice to heal wounds. Only a single healing poultice can be applied at a time.

    When healing, roll the same die as your most common hit die. If you don't have a hit die value for any reason, roll a d4.

    Price: 5 sp

    The milk of this vibrantly green cactus, when mixed with resins and other ingredients, congeals into sticky, black chunks with an exceedingly sour taste. Though pesh comes in several different varieties, refined pesh is both the most potent and expensive type. Taking refined pesh gives a person 15 temporary hit points for 1 hour, a +2 bonus on saves versus fear effects for 1 day, and disadvantage to Dexterity and Wisdom checks for 1 day. Pesh is addictive (Constitution save DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Dexterity and Wisdom damage.


-   #### Pomander of Warding

    Price: 15 gp

    This ball of aromatic spices and perfumes fills an area with a 15 foot radius with a strong scent for 24 hours after being unwrapped. Undead creatures of CR 2 or lower that enter this area must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10) or be turned, as detailed in the Turn Undead cleric feature.


-   #### Potion of Healing

    Can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>.

    This cold, black potion tastes strongly of old coffee and sour milk. It fizzes when shaken.

    Stamina potions grant a small burst of energy to those suffering from exhaustion—a potential life-saver on long, dangerous journeys far from a safe resting place. When you drink a stamina potion, you can ignore a small amount of exhaustion for one hour. This energy boost is short-lived, however, and your exhaustion returns in full strength once the potion wears off—make sure you're not in a dangerous position when it does

    You may ignore some exhaustion for one hour when you drink this potion—the better the quality, the more exhaustion you can ignore.

    <div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

    | Quality | Recovery | Cost |
    |:--------|:---------|:-----|

    Can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>.

    This potion of boiled water and herbs gives increased energy and dulls pain.

    Drinking this potion grants you temporary hit points. Outside of combat or other strenuous activity, you retain these hit points for 1 hour or until you take sufficient damage. While in combat or similar situations which would keep your blood pumping and metabolism high, this time is reduced to 1 minute. After the duration of the potion expires (not when you lose the hit points), you must make a Constitution save. Failure causes you to suffer 1 level of exhaustion.

    The better the quality, the more temporary hit points you gain. When you drink a potion of vigor, roll the same die as your most common hit die. If you don't have a hit die value for any reason, roll a d4.

    <div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

    | Quality | Recovery | Save DC | Cost |
    |:--------|:---------|:--------|:-----|

-   #### Purple Pipeweed

    Price: 1 gp

    Pipeweed commonly smoked by spellcasters that focus on illusory magic. For one hours after smoking a quantity of pipeweed, the consumer is elevated to a higher state of imagination. This unfortunately makes them inattentive, (enemies in combat will always have a surprise round against the pipeweed smoker while he or she is under its effects) but also increases the spell save DC of any illusion magic cast by the pipeweed user by +2.


-   #### Sage

    Price: 4 cp \
    Sage is a soft, blue-green leaf that is dried and burned as an incense to achieve its effect, purifying a 20’ square foot area. The purified area repels negative residual emotions and spiritual energies. While burning in an area, any evil or evil act is at a disadvantage while it is in the area. If used in conjunction with a spell that protects from evil, it extends the duration by 50%.

    It can also be used as an additional material component while casting the spell _glyph of warding_ as a ritual. If you do, creatures and objects in the glyph's area of effect when it activates are also targeted by _dispel magic_.

    Certain types of sage can also be used as a culinary herb.


-   #### Sakrash (Twilight wine)

    Price: 10 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    Sweet oily wine. You cannot be detected by effects that read or alter thoughts or emotions for 1d4 hours. However, your eyes become sensitive to bright light, causing disadvantage on all saves against light effects.


-   #### Shinewater

    Price: 10 gp

    This comes in a large 2 lbs jar. Removes all rust and corrosion from metal objects left to soak in it overnight. One dose de-rusts a medium-sized metal weapon.


-   #### Sparkleberry jam/jelly

    Price: 5 gp

    Consumption of the jam or jelly grants resistance to radiant damage for 5 minutes.


-   #### Sun Pepper

    Price: 2 gp

    These small, yellow peppers are extremely spicy. Eating one restores 1d6+2 hp, but imparts a cumulative -2 penalty to all skill checks for the next hour


-   #### Sun pepper concentrate

    Price: 5 gp

    A translucent crimson concoction with purple flakes suspended within it. The fumes produced by the solution are highly irritating to one's eyes. As an **_action_**, you can splash the contents of this vial onto an adjacent creature or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack, treating the concentrate as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is blinded for 1 minute or it makes a DC 12 constitution check. Target may attempt the save again at the end of each of its rounds.


-   #### Terrap sap

    Price: 10 gp

    When first opened, this sealed jar releases such an overwhelmingly antiseptic odor that it covers other smells until it disperses (1d6+1 rounds after opening). Creatures within 20 feet of the jar gain advantage on all saves against scent-based attacks while the sap’s odor remains, but they automatically fail any scent-based Perception checks during that time.


-   #### Yewclaw incense

    Price: 100 gp

    When this yellowish incense is burnt, the resultant smoke calms the mind when deeply inhaled, suppressing a short-term madness completely, and easing a long-term madness for one hour.


-   #### Willowshade oil

    Price: 50 gp

    A dark blue oil can be extracted from the fruit of the Willowshade plant. A creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been petrified for less than 1 minute, causing the petrified condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature’s next turn.
