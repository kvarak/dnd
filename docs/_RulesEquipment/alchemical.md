    </div>

-   #### Acid

    Price: 10 gp

    As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage


-   #### Air crystals

    Price: 5 gp

    These unpleasant-tasting, alchemically grown crystals release breathable air when chewed. A pouch of air crystals provides 1 minute of breathable air. Any attempt to speak while chewing air crystals negates any remaining duration.


-   #### Air sponge

    Price: 50 gp

    It looks like a white sponge, about twice the size of a man’s fist, but instead of absorbing water, it has been alchemically treated to hold a surprising amount of air. Even when immersed in water, the air sponge will hold its air, leaking only an occasional tiny bubble. The air sponge holds enough air for the average medium sized creature to take three full breaths from it before it is depleted, allowing the user to remain underwater much longer than would normally be possible. Each breath taken from the air sponge “resets” the user’s Constitution checks against drowning. The air sponge can be refilled with air simply by squeezing it, so long as the user is in a place where air is available – it obviously cannot be refilled under water.


-   #### Alchemical solvent

    Price: 10 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    This bubbling purple gel eats through adhesives. Each vial can cover a single 5-foot square. It destroys normal adhesives (such as tar, tree sap, or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more powerful adhesives (tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and so on). It has no effect on fully magical adhesives, including sovereign glue.


-   #### Alchemical Torch

    Cost 25 gp

    The rough, sticky tar at the end of this torch traps air, keeping it burning through even the most adverse conditions. An alchemical torch burns for 1 hour and continues to smolder in heavy rains, strong winds, and underwater (albeit poorly when submerged, shedding only dim light in a 5-foot radius). Dimmer than a normal torch, it burns for 1 hour and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning alchemical torch and hit, the tar binds to the target, dealing 1 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.


-   #### Alchemist’s fire

    Price: 10 gp

    This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.


-   #### Alkali salt

    Price: 10 gp

    These tiny granules can be dissolved in water, creating a slimy material used to coat metallic items such as weapons or armor. Such a coating neutralizes the metal-eating acid of black puddings,  gray oozes and rust monsters, protecting the item from 1d6 contacts. The coating will stay on until you sheathe a weapon or take a rest in an armor.


-   #### Allnight

    Price: 5 gp

    This treated wafer dissolves into a chalky paste when placed under the tongue and then gives the imbiber a jolt of restless energy. It eliminates the effects of fatigue for the next 8 hours; when the drug’s effect ends, the user gains a level of exhaustion. Allnight makes its users jittery and unable to focus; they suffer a –2 penalty on all skill checks until its effects wear off.


-   #### Dragon's Breath

    Price: 20 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    A golden liquid with a strong smell of spices and feels like drinking molten lava. It heals for 2d6 + Con mod and removes one level of exhaustion. The drinker has a tingly feeling throughout their body for the next 2d4 hours.


-   #### Cooling gel

    Price: 5 gp

    This cold blue gel provides a +1 bonus for one hour on saves against fire and heat, or heals 1d8 burn damage if applied within one hour.


-   #### Darkflare

    Price: 10 gp

    Created by drow-hunters, this alchemical flare explodes in black sparks 1 round after lighting. Any creature within 5 feet of the darkflare when it explodes must make a DC 13 Constitution save or be unable to see with darkvision for 1d10 rounds. Affected creatures can still see in normal light with no penalty. A darkflare has no effect on creatures without darkvision.


-   #### Deodorizing agent

    Price: 5 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    Coating a creature in a vial of this milky, odorless substance takes 1 minute and renders it scentless for 1d3 hours. Creatures that rely on scent for locating creatures do not gain the benefit of this ability against a creature affected by a dose of deodorizing agent.


-   #### Distilled Courage

    Price: 10 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    When you use this alcohol as a material component to cast the _false life_ spell, you have advantage on the first charisma check you make before the spell ends.


-   #### Facemold Paste

    Cost 25 gp

    This thick clay can be produced in any color and is easily moldable over skin. After it sets, it is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. With 1 minute of work, you can use facemold paste to create a convincing disguise, even if you are not proficient with or lack a disguise kit. When using facemold paste, you may add twice your proficiency bonus to any check made to make or maintain the disguise. Facemold paste remains convincing for only 3 hours before starting to flake off and is immediately identifiable as fake upon touch.


-   #### Firebane

    Price: 25 gp

    This thick grease provides resistance to fire for one half hour if smeared over the entire body. Unless washed from the body after that time, it causes damage (1 fire damage/min).


-   #### Flash powder

    Price: 10 gp

    This coarse gray powder ignites and burns almost instantly if exposed to flame, significant friction, or even a simple force such as throwing it against a floor. Creatures within the 10-foot-radius burst are blinded for 1 round (Dexterity save DC 13 negates).

-   #### Ghost Essence

    Price: 100 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    The imbiber leaves his physical body and becomes a visible but incorporeal creature. While in this state, the user’s speed is doubled, but he can take no actions other than movement and visual observation. While in this state, the spirit is invulnerable to physical harm, but not magical damage.

    **Benefit**: Character becomes incorporeal for 10 minutes, allowing them to pass through solid objects. They are immune to physical attacks but magic still effects them.

    **Side Effects**: The user is drowsy for one hour after returning to his body.

    **Drawback**: Each time the person drinks one of these potions, there is a cumulative 1% chance that the effect becomes permanent, and the user can never return to their body. Unless magically preserved, the body will wither and die within 3 days.


-   #### Ghostbane Oil

    Price: 30 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    When applied to a weapon, allows it to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures. The benefit lasts only for a few swings (2d4).


-   #### Glass gargle

    Price: 5 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    Glass gargle is a gritty, cloudy liquid that, when gargled, roughens the voice, lowering it in both pitch and timbre. A character who uses glass gargle gains a +2 bonus on checks to hide his identity (when applicable), but suffers an equal penalty to all Perform skill checks involving vocal performance.


-   #### Liquid ice

    Price: 20 gp

    Also known as “Alchemist’s ice,” this sealed jar of crystalline blue fluid immediately starts to evaporate once opened. During the next 1d6 rounds, you can use it to freeze a liquid or to coat an object in a thin layer of ice. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold damage; creatures within 5 feet of where it hits take 1 point of cold damage from the splash.


-   #### Noxious aromatic

    Price: 10 gp

    This glass container of foul-smelling oil shatters easily upon impact. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. If a creature with the scent ability is standing in the square of impact, it must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution save or be incapacitated for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature with scent in an adjacent square must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 round. Creatures without the scent ability are not affected by the noxious aromatic.


-   #### Powdered chalk

    Price: 1 cp

    Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals if there is an invisible creature there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.

-   #### Smelling salt

    Price: 5 gp

    These sharply scented gray crystals cause people inhaling them to regain consciousness. Smelling salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you unconscious, sleeping or stunned. If exposed to smelling salts while dying, you immediately become conscious and incapacitated, but must still make stabilization checks each round. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of minutes if left opened.


-   #### Smoke pellet

    Price: 10 gp

    This small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When you break the sphere, the substances mingle and fill a 5-foot square with a cloud of foul but harmless yellow smoke. Treat the effect as a _fog cloud _spell, except the smoke only lasts for 1 round before dispersing.


-   #### Smokestick

    Price: 10 gp

    This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a _fog cloud _spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.


-   #### Spellpower Potion

    Can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>.

    This glowing, blue potion glistens with tiny crystalline fragments. It tastes of lightning and glass.

    Spellpower potions infuse your body with a sudden burst of magical power—but at the cost of some stamina. When you drink this potion, you may spend one hit die and regain one expended spell slot of your choosing—the better the quality of the potion, the higher the maximum spell slot level.  If you don't have any hit dice, you may instead gain a level of exhaustion.


    <div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

    | Quality | Max spell slots | Cost |
    |:--------|:----------------|:-----|
    | Lesser | 1st level | 30 gp
    | Greater | 2nd level | 50 gp
    | Superior | 3rd level | 150 gp
    | Supreme | 5th level | 500 gp

    </div>

-   #### Tindertwig

    Price: 1 sp

    The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig takes only a round.


-   #### Troll oil

    Price: 25 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    This disgusting crimson liquid is viscous and tastes foul. If you drink it, for the next hour you have advantage on all stabilization rolls when reduced to 0 hit points and have a 50% chance each round to end any bleeding effect on you. However, drinking this liquid is not so easy as it is really foul. A successful DC 8 Constitution save is required to avoid being sickened and keeping the liquid down after drinking it. If you succeed by less than 5, you are sickened (as the poisoned condition) for the full duration.


-   #### Trollweed

    Price: 10 gp

    This is a magical psychoactive plant, harvested from the skin of trolls. It can be smoked, eaten, or brewed as a tea to allow the user to see magic and magical auras. It is also used as an ingredient in many potions and poisons. Its effects are myriad and magical in nature depending on how it is processed.

    Warning – Trollweed has been known to cause hallucinations and prophetic visions in some particularly sensitive individuals.

    **Benefit**: Character can detect magic for 30 minutes.

    **Side Effects**: Possible hallucinations and visions. Character must make a CON save (DC 12) after 20 minutes, or suffer hallucinations and/or visions (GMs discretion)


-   #### Unguent of revivification

    Price: 10 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    The preservation of dead flesh is important in undead-friendly cultures. In such places this alchemical ointment is commonly used as a cheaper alternative to the _gentle repose _spell to give their undead flesh the blush of life. A single dose staves off the decomposition of dead flesh for 1d6 days. It cannot reverse decay that is already present and has no effect on the time limit for raising creatures from the dead.


-   #### Vapors of sleep

    Price: 5 gp, can be purchased in a <a href="a_index.html#internal-Flasks">flask</a>

    When applied to a cloth and held over the nose and mouth, it forces the target to make a Constitution save (DC 13) or sleep for 1d4 hours. It can be thrown as a ranged improvised weapon, breaking on impact and causing those who fail the save (DC 13) to become drowsy and disoriented and suffer -2 to all actions for 1d4 rds.
