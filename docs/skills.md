# Skills

A skill represents a specific knowledge and an individual’s level of proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.

### When do I get skills?
You will get skill points to select skills during character creation, as well as when you level up.
- During character creation, when rolling your background, you will get skills appropriate for the events in your life. If you get less than 3 skills (4 for humans), you can select additional skills so that you have 3. Additionally you always gain the appropriate Culture skill (unless living as a hermit or similar). Skills found in Background Skills are only available at this time.
- Each class receives a number of skill points for which to buy skills from a list of class skills.
- Each time you level up, you gain 1 skill point, which you can use to buy any skill.
- In addition, classes may have class features that grant skills or skill points.

### Spending skill points
Unless otherwise noted, each skill costs 1 skill point. To buy a skill you must know the skill right above it in the “skill tree”. You can save skill points, and are allowed to spend them at a later time, after finishing a long rest. Additionally you can spend skill points the following ways.
- **Ability Score Increase**. You can spend 2 skill points to increase an ability score by 1.
- **Improved Proficiency**. After you have Expertise with a skill, you can spend 2 skill points to gain +1 to all checks with that skill. You can improve it even further, increasing the cost by 1 point each time you buy this.

### Terms
- **Cost: X**. This skill costs a number of skill points equal to X.
- **Expertise**. You have advantage on checks using this proficiency.
- **Expertise (Ability X, Ability Y)**. You have advantage, but one of the dice uses ability modifier X and the other ability modifier Y.
- **Group**. This is a group of skills, so you do not learn it completely. Select one of the skills in the description instead.
- **Synergy (X)**. If you have proficiency with skill X, gain advantage when using that skill.
- **Trait**. A trait is like a binary skill; either you can do it or not. A roll is not required in most cases.
- **Untrained**. Unless a trait or a specialized activity, this skill can normally be attempted without having proficiency.
- **→ X**. If you have proficiency with skill X, the cost of this skill is reduced by 1.

## Untrained Skills

  This skill mixes various physical performances with feats of extraordinary balance, agility and coordination.

If it does not allow a check, you can still make an Dexterity (Roll with the blow) check against a DC equal to damage dealt, or if no damage, a DC of 15.

  <summary>Animal Handling (Group, Untrained)</summary>
  <div markdown="1">
  Animal handling is a Group of similar skills that describe the practical handling of animals. The first time you select this skill group, choose a category of animals that you are familiar with. You also gain the Handle animal skill. After the first time, you select either an animal category or a skill. In most cases a skill applies to all categories you have selected.

  **Category**: The animal categories are divided into general and specific types. The general types also include the specific as appropriate, but selecting a specific type of animal grants additional benefits.

  **General**
  * Amphibians. Some tribes in swampy areas use giant frogs/toads for transport, as well as regular sized amphibians that are used for different purposes.
  * Birds. Birds are seldom domesticated. When they are, it is usually for companionship (parrots, falcons, etc).
  * Bugs & Spiders. Neither are common, but can be found in some underground societies, most notable the riding spiders of Drow. Hardy giant beetles can be used as pack animals in desert environments.
  * Farm Animals. This includes the animals used in human farms, such as dogs, horses, cows and sheep, but also fowl of different types.
  * Mammals (land). Includes mammals that are sometimes domesticated, such as elephants and camels. This would also with more experience include the training of other mammals such as tiger and elk.
  * Reptiles. Lizards are used as riding and pack animals in many underground societies.
  * Sea Life. Folk living underwater use a wide variety of sea living creatures as mounts. For surface dwellers this could apply to seals or dolphins.

  **Specific**
  * Camels. Camels are used as transportation and for the purpose of combat. If you enter into the campaign with this skill, it is presumed that a trained and familiar camel is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year. In addition you are eligible to take the following skill.
    * Desert Navigation. Provides heightened knowledge through learning to trust the camel's survival instincts in order to better survive. Gain Expertise on Desert survival checks.

  * Dogs. If you enter into the campaign with this skill, it is presumed that a trained and familiar dog is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year. This can be a riding dog if you are small enough.

  * Falconry. The gallant union between the character and bird, pursued for sport, for war — and for the companionship that results. In essence, the falcon (hawk, eagle or owl) exists in a state of semi-captivity, a wildness that is tempered by training. They are, naturally, commanded; but as the bird retains its capacity to act alone, and with ferociousness in attacking its prey, it is not correct to think of the animal as "tame."
  Additionally, the falcon serves as a status symbol, for the mastery of these birds is viewed as a sign of quality lineage and personal worth, which is reflected in the skills below. If you enter into the campaign with this skill, it is presumed that a trained and familiar bird is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year. In addition you are eligible to take the following skills.
    * Rouse Admiration. Capture the attention and impress persons with great power and status. You have Expertise on such checks.
    * Send Home (→ Animal Training, trait). You have trained your bird so you send it with a message to a location and person it has been trained to recognize.

  * Horses. The use of the horse (and donkeys, mules, etc) for transportation, combat and work. If you enter into the campaign with this skill, it is presumed that a trained and familiar horse is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year.

  * Riding Lizards. The use of a riding lizard as transportation and for the purpose of combat. If you enter into the campaign with this skill, it is presumed that a trained and familiar riding lizard is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year. In addition you are eligible to take the following skill.
    * Underdark Navigation. Provides heightened knowledge through learning to trust the lizards's survival instincts in order to better survive. Gain Expertise on Underdark survival checks.

  **Skills**
  Unless otherwise noted, the skills below apply to all categories of animals you are familiar with and only to “normal” domesticable animals.

  <details>
    <summary>Handle Animal</summary>
    You have familiarity with some categories of animals. This skill is used when there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked or intuit an animal’s intentions.

    <details>
      <summary>Animal Husbandry</summary>
      The skill to keep, raise, and properly use domestic animals for work and food. You know the minimum environment an animal must be kept in, the proper food to feed it and how to keep the animal from running off. This skill would normally not be rolled for.

        Proficiency with selective breeding of animals. This is a long term activity normally not possible to do during adventuring with the exception of long downtimes.

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Teamster</summary>
        Provides skill at the employment of common domestic farm animals as beasts of burden, plow teams or as animals to pull carts, wagons and carriages. You have Expertise on travel checks when handling animals this way, as well as on checks to control wagons or chariots.

    <details>
      <summary>Animal Training</summary>
      The skill to train animals tricks, such as "Speak” or “Fetch" as well as teaching animals to do a specific job, such as pulling a wagon, or guarding an item on command. Unless an already domesticated animal, this process takes months. However if you start the game with this skill or any other skill in this category, it is presumed that a trained and familiar animal is already in your possession, and that you have developed a companionship of at least one year.
      <div class="skill-frame">You can use a bonus action to command your trained animal, deciding now what action the beast will take and where it will move during its next turn. You can also issue a general command such as to guard a particular area. Depending on the animal this command might last for 10 minutes to an hour.</div>
      <details>
        <summary>Combat Training</summary>
        You have proficiency with techniques needed to train an appropriate animal to attack and fight.

        <div class="skill-frame">War-trained template<br/>
        Add proficiency with all barding and with the Athletics skill.<br/>
        The animal uses the highest of its own or its current master’s proficiency bonus, and its minimum number of hit dice is twice that proficiency bonus.<br/>
        The training also conveys advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saves if the creature can see and hear its trainer/master when it makes the save.

        <details>
          <summary>Unconventional Combat Training</summary>
          You have learnt techniques needed to train an inappropriate animal to attack and fight. You could for example, if you really wanted, combat train a chicken.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>War Training (trait)</summary>
          You have mastered techniques making it possible to train animals for combat during a short period of time. You may train an animal in 1/4 the usual time (adding the “war-trained” template to the animal in five weeks, rather than five months, for example).
        </details>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Companionship Training</summary>
        The way you train beasts is more focused on companionship. This is a simpler task that can usually be done in a week. When you take this skill it is assumed that you have practiced this for a while, allowing you to have a group of companion animals that follow you. Choose a number of beasts from your familiar animal categories with challenge rating 0 (such as rats, ravens, spiders, or tiny dogs) equal to your proficiency bonus. They do not all need to be the same type of beast. These are your companion animals. When your proficiency bonus increases you gain another companion animal.
        Your companion animals are well trained. They follow your orders and can understand commands and tasks as complex as a trained rat might, but are not suitable for combat. In combat your companions only take the dash, disengage, and dodge actions and have the frightened condition of all enemies.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Hunt Training</summary>

How remarkable was the deed itself? Glory comes not only from unequaled victory, but victory achieved with risk that is taken on behalf of others. Thus sacrifice, suffering and regard for others — which must take place in front of witnesses, that stories might be told — are also part of heroism's tradition. You gain the following ability.<br/>

  Medicine is the study of maintaining and restoring the health of humanoids, as well as treating their illness and preventing the effects of poison.

While an ordinary observer may see a crowd acting with high emotion and believe that the assemblage is an ordinary mob or rabble, persons with this knowledge will recognize there is much more going on than meets the eye. The mania might be driven by a natural hysterical contagion, the influence of a powerful magical individual or force, a physical or mental disease, brought about by a plague or even by parasitic infestation, or it might have an otherworldly connection.

      To identify a cause, you will need to obtain full access to an individual suffering from the mania. A close examination of less than a minute is all that is needed to identify someone affected and someone that is not — as many within a crowd will move along due to confusion or curiosity.

Ten minutes of observation — which consists of asking questions, manipulating the victim or otherwise poking and prodding, much of which will require the victim to be restrained — allows you to make an Wisdom (Insight) check to reveal the cause — but not the source — of the mania.

Religion
(Untrained)
The Religion skill covers your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, divine agents and holy symbols regarding the main pantheon within your culture, as well as the cultures for which you have the appropriate Culture skill.


* Acolyte (group). You have formal in-depth training on one particular deity and the patheon it belongs to. Select a deity. You are always assumed to have rolled a 20 on any checks regarding the chosen deity, unless it is regarding the finer points of theology, obscure myths or secret knowledge. If a check is required you have Expertise, both for questions regarding the deity, as well as its pantheon.
   * Student of the Holy (cumulative, trait). Studying holy books and listening to sermons has exposed you to many generations of wisdom. Gain +1 Wisdom.


* Divine Magic. You have knowledge on the holy magic that is provided by the gods to their devoted followers. A Wisdom (Divine magic) check measures your ability to recall lore about divine spells and magical traditions. It does not infer any knowledge on Arcane or Primal magic, with the exception of possibly knowing which category a phenomena might belong to.


Identifying A Spell
Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.


If the character perceives the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Wisdom (Divine magic) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level.


   * Divine Defense. You have seen enough divine magic to understand the limitations and flaws that deities impose on most spells they grant. You have Expertise when using a reaction to identify a divine spell being cast. If you recognize it, you gain advantage on any saves against that spell.


   * Divine Symbolism. You recognize many of the protective symbols, objects and even gestures intended to turn away harm or evil influences, as in deflecting misfortune or averting the evil eye. As most of these symbols have their origin in religion, you would recognize such practices and would be able to make an educated guess whether they actually ward against something, or just made out of vague superstition or out of tradition.


This also includes symbols used in the creation of magical barriers and protections used to contain summoned entities, allowing you to deduce what or who a ward is designed to keep out or in, as well as its integrity and how it can be maintained.


You have Expertise on checks to deduce the purpose of such symbols, regardless of faith of the creators of the symbols.


   * Incarneum. The returning of souls from beyond death. Such magic is viewed as heretical when not performed by clerics that channel the powers of their god, which is seen as having the blessing of both the keeper of the soul, and the soul itself. Doing so without divine guidance, i.e. using arcane magic, inevitably darkens the soul and gives rise to undead creatures that are trapped in an unlife of torment. You possess theoretical knowledge on the workings of resurrection, souls and the nature of sentient undead, and have Expertise on checks to recall lore regarding those matters.
      * Spiritualism. The contacting of souls from beyond death, often involving consulting the spirits of the dead about information they knew in life. This skill grants Expertise on checks to communicate to spirits.
      * Undead. This skill lets you identify sentient undead and may grant insight on how to combat creatures and how to put them to rest.
         * Battle Undead (trait). Provides +2 AC against sentient undead.
         * Exorcism. You have some knowledge in how to banish an undead manifestation with the use of proper exorcism tools. This is most commonly multiple holy symbols, but some undead may have other specific items that can drive them away. You can attempt to turn an incorporeal undead with an opposed skill check against the target’s Wisdom save. You cannot attempt to banish the same creature again until 24 hours have passed.


   * Outer Planes. Many creatures of religious significance (like celestials and fiends) reside in the Outer planes, and as such, are of interest to a scholar of religion. This skill grants knowledge on the features of the Outer planes and the beings that reside within. You also know how to properly address such supernatural entities in a proper way, gaining Expertise on checks made when conversing with them.


   * Prophecy. Deities have the power to send prophetic visions to their worshipers, granting insight on secrets long forgotten, to predict the future and to find things hidden. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about divinations and prophecies, as well as on checks to interpret them.


   * Residual Divinity (trait). If you are a divine spellcaster, you have gained the favor of your deity, who has granted you the strength to continue caring for your flock. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to an ally, you gain temporary hit points equal to the highest die value that you roll. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.


   * Ritual Magic. Casting spells through careful rituals to appease the gods is common among their followers. Many ritualized sermons have an origin in magic rituals. You understand how these types of rituals are written down and how to perform them, even to the extent that you have learnt a few. When you choose this skill, it is assumed that you have spent enough time researching to have acquired a ritual book holding two divine 1st-level ritual spells of your choice. Casting a spell from your ritual book requires you to have it at hand.


If you come across a divine ritual spell in written form you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up). The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 1 hour per level of the spell, and costs 10 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.


* Preach. The skill to leverage your religion to deliver a sermon and influencing an audience to adopt moral truth, right conduct and worthy leadership. You have Expertise on such checks.


* Religious Bureaucracy. The hierarchies and bureaucracy of the religious organizations can sometimes be very complicated to get around. Many old customs and people strictly adhering to outdated rules can make it next to impossible to find the help you need. However, you are well acquainted with the way church bureaucracy works, and can greatly reduce the time needed to navigate such institutions. Gain Expertise on such checks.


Speechcraft
(Untrained)
This is the skill to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and can also represent a charming or commanding personality. It would be used when you try to influence others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. Unless otherwise noted, the skills in this category require targets to understand you.
* Actor. You are skilled at acting and dramatics and have Expertise on such checks, including checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.


* Deception. You are good at convincingly hiding the truth, either verbally or through your actions. You have Expertise when attempting to mislead one or very few persons with ambiguity or even telling outright lies in a short-term situation. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie. This check would normally be resolved as an opposed check against the victim’s Wisdom (Insight).
   * Acceptance. The skill to "fit in" among persons of different cultures and social class, and thus be "accepted" as one of them. While Deception might be used to talk a guard into letting you enter a masquerade ball, this skill would be used to convincingly keep up the charade during a whole evening, making sure that everyone at the event has the same image of you and there are no inconsistencies in your story. The same skill set is used no matter if the character needs to fit in during a high socialite gala or a rowdy night of drinking in a seedy bar. You have Expertise when using this skill.
   * Deception II. You have the confidence to convincingly lie or hide the truth to a large group of people. Paradoxically this is often easier than lying to one person. You have Expertise when using this skill.
      * Sheeple. The skill to motivate a large group of people towards a panicked action upon a pre-existing fear or prejudice by direct suggestion. You have Expertise when attempting this action.
   * Fraud. The art of swindling by first gaining the confidence of others, then using it to part them from their wealth. This can also include co-opting the positions of the target. Fraud is a long-term version of deception, taking weeks of work to set into motion. You have Expertise when using this skill.
   * Gaslight. The skill to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual's own memory, perception or judgement, leading the victim towards an intended action. This process takes days or weeks. You have Expertise when using this skill.
   * Guile. The skill to deceive others about your intent, integrity, appearance and reason for being for a long period of time. It enables a character to adopt a disguise or level of confidence, enabling them to spy where they do not belong and even rise within the hierarchy of organizations to which they do not legitimately belong. You have Expertise when using this skill.
   * Insert Memory. You know how to plant a plausible, minor memory in a person’s thoughts regarding an event that took place at least a year ago, such as having met once before at some event. This is something that can be done during the first minutes of a conversation, and unless the target has no reason to question the event, this effect is permanent. You have Expertise when using this skill, which would normally be resolved as an opposed check against the target’s Wisdom (Insight).


* Improved Charisma (cumulative, trait). You know how to keep the interest of people. Gain +1 Charisma.


* Intimidation. You are skilled at making a person believe that you will follow through on your actions when trying to influence through overt threats, hostile actions and physical violence, granting you Expertise (Str, Cha). Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing a street thug to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.
   * Intimidation II. You also have Expertise (Str, Cha) when attempting to intimidate a group of people.


* Mercantilism. This includes the skill and ability to raise capital, organize and manage loans, control wages, maximize profit on resources, encourage manufacturing, avoid tariffs, fees and other taxes and in general create a successful and complex business through a combination of innovation and guile.

* Orator. Mastery of storytelling for the purpose of captivating an audience, granting Expertise on suck checks.


* Seduction. You are skilled at seduction and get Expertise on all such checks.


* Tact. This skill is used when you attempt to influence someone with tact, social graces, or good nature. Typically it is used when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. You have Expertise when using this skill.
   * Diplomacy. Similar to Tact, but you also have Expertise when attempting to influence a group of people. Examples include negotiating peace between warring tribes or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
Stealth
(Untrained)
The art of not being seen, through actions and the application of camouflage and disguise. A Stealth check is made when you attempt to stalk a target, wait within a short distance of an enemy without drawing attention, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard. A stealth check is usually resolved as an opposed check against one or several targets’ Perception or Insight.


* Terrain (group). You are skilled at camouflage and concealment within a specific terrain. Select one of the terrains below. You have Expertise when attempting to hide yourself or sneak alone within that terrain. Stealth in an urban environment is its own skill (Urban Stealth).
   * Arctic
   * Coastal
   * Desert
   * Forest
   * Grassland
   * Jungle
   * Mountains - includes Alpine mountains
   * Ocean, mainly underwater
   * Planar - specify plane. Examples include Abyss, Acheron, Astral plane, Hell
   * Ruins, including worked underground areas
   * Rural
   * Subterranean (a.k.a. Underdark)

________________


   * Camouflage. Your familiarity with the terrain allows you to attempt to hide even when just lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding. This applies to all selected terrains.
   * Covert professional. Your skill extends to camouflaging buildings, vehicles and larger groups of people. You have Expertise within all selected terrains, on checks when attempting to hide or sneak with groups of people or objects.
   * Passing Through (trait). You are patient and know how to wait for the right moment. If you are hidden, you can move up to 10 ft in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you’re not clearly visible. This applies to all selected terrains.


* Urban Stealth.  You know your way around a city and have Expertise when attempting to hide yourself or sneak alone in an urban environment.
   * Evaporate. You can apparently disappear into a crowd, even while under direct observation. You have Expertise on such checks.
   * Indiscernible. You are skilled at escaping attention and seem unassuming. Even people you might have spoken to during an event or similar have a hard time remembering you. You have Expertise on checks to evade notice.
   * Passing Through (trait). Enables you to "slip past" others without being seen. This is possible even in broad daylight, even if there are guards present — the trick requires waiting for the right moment. To determine when the moment occurs, a d100 is rolled, giving a time of 1 to 100 minutes. This indicates how long a character must wait; this number is withheld from the player. One attempt can be made to pass a given site per day. Up to four guards may be circumvented; more offer too many chances for a passing character to be seen. Access must be unblocked. The passing character cannot be visibly armored or seen to be carrying weapons.


Example of Movement. Natasha wishes to enter a citadel inside a town, where there are two guards posted. She can see the large double door is slightly ajar, giving her enough room to slip insider. Because it may take a lot of time before her chance occurs (1 to 100 minutes), Natasha dresses in a way that doesn't attract attention. She posits a reasonable cover. selling flowers, busking or having two companions along that engage her in conversation.
For each 30-minute period that Natasha waits, one random person present — someone in authority — will make a wisdom check. If successful, the guard, or other person responsible, will approach Natasha and make inquiries. If so, she must either make haste to leave or explain her presence. A bad explanation could produce bullying or threats against Natasha, who must decide what to do. In any case, the opportunity to pass has been lost.

Knowledge Skills
Arcana
You have studied the basics of the arcane arts and the processes of Arcane magic. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. It does not infer any knowledge on Divine or Primal magic, with the exception of possibly knowing which category a phenomena might belong to.


Identifying A Spell
Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.


If the character perceives the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell belongs to a school in which you have skill, the check is made with advantage.


* Arcane Defense. You have studied enough magic to understand the limitations and flaws of most spells. You have Expertise when using a reaction to identify an arcane spell being cast. If you recognize it, you gain advantage on any saves against that spell.
   * Mage Slayer. You have practiced techniques useful to combat spellcasters and gain the following benefits.
   * When an adjacent arcane spellcaster casts a spell, you can use a reaction to make a melee attack against that creature. In addition, if you are the target, you have Expertise on saves against the effect.
   * When you damage a creature concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on saves to maintain concentration.


* Arcane Symbols. You recognize many of the symbols used during the practise of arcane magic and have Expertise on checks to deduce the purpose of such symbols.


* Artifice. The understanding of how magic is infused and bound in objects. This skill allows you to better analyze and understand the secrets of magic items and artifacts, granting Expertise on checks concerning magical items, including researching its history, identifying its existence or deducing its use. If you examine an item or area for 10 minutes, treat it as if you had cast detect magic.
   * Master Attuner. Your superior understanding of magic items allows you to master their use, allowing you to attune to one additional magic item.
   * Read Scrolls. You're able to decode arcane spell scrolls, allowing you to understand them and cast its spells regardless of class requirements. Use this skill instead of an ability check to cast a scroll’s spell if its level is no higher than your proficiency bonus.  Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for any spell you cast from a spell scroll.


* Ritual Magic. Your knowledge in the arcane arts specializes in the ritual casting of spells. This grants you the knowledge to understand how rituals are written and how to perform them, even to the extent that you have learnt a few. When you choose this skill, it is assumed that you have spent enough time researching to have acquired a ritual book holding two arcane 1st-level ritual spells of your choice. Casting a spell from your ritual book requires you to have it at hand.


If you come across an arcane ritual spell in written form, such as a magical scroll or a wizard’s spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up). The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 1 hour per level of the spell, and costs 10 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.




Arcane magic is divided into eight different categories, or schools, according to the types of magical energy they utilize. Each school has its own special methods and practices. Although they are called schools, schools of magic are not organized places where a person goes to study. The word “school” identifies an approach to magic and a magical discipline of spellcasting.


* Abjuration. Abjuration is a school of magic which specializes in protective magic. In general this type of magic is used to keep things out,  preventing things from appearing and getting rid of those that already have. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Abjuration magic.
   * Apotropaic Magic. The creation of protective symbols, objects and even gestures intended to turn away harm or evil influences, as in deflecting misfortune or averting the evil eye. As an expert in this field, you would recognize such practices and would be able to make an educated guess whether they actually ward against something, or just made out of vague superstition or out of tradition. In addition you can make a limited number of such symbols. Not yet available.
   * Barrier Wards. A field of abjuration that deals with the creation of magical barriers and protections used to contain summoned entities. Barrier wards need to be anchored to some kind of physical demarcation - like a magic circle or a series of glyphs. This skill allows you to deduce what or who a ward is designed to keep out or in, as well as its integrity and how it can be maintained.
   * Practical Application - Mage Armor. You’ve learned how to empower the mage armor spell. The first time each day you cast the spell, it does not expend a spell slot. In addition, the target’s base AC can be either 13 + Dexterity modifier or 16 (your choice).
   * Protective Wards. The skill of applying protective designs painted onto a person’s body. Such designs need to be exposed for them to work and are used as protective "war paint" in many traditions. They are prone to being short lived - especially if the user insists on washing (or even just sweating) and may come off on clothing, terrain and such.
      * Tattoo Ward (→ Tattooing, trait). You can use tattooing tools to make protective wards more permanent. This may have other side effects and/or need to be recharged regularly. Not yet available.
   * Ward Mage (trait). You have learned how to bolster your shields, barriers, and walls of magic beyond their normal capabilities in order to better control a battlefield and protect yourself and your allies. You gain the following benefits..
   * When a spell or class feature grants a protective ward with hit points, you grant that ward extra hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
   * When you create a wall or barrier with no creature as a target (ex. wall of stone), you increase the hit points of that object by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus and its AC by 2.
   * When a spell you cast grants a creature temporary hp, you increase the hp by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
   * Any creature that has its AC increased from a spell you cast or that has a protective ward with hit points granted by a spell you cast also has an additional + 1 bonus to AC. This bonus is not cumulative.


* Conjuration. Magic that gathers tendrils of arcane power and forces a form upon it, creating matter, creatures and even bridges to other realms. Conjurations bring manifestations of objects or creatures to you (the summoning subschool), actually transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane (calling), transport creatures or objects over great distances (apportation), or create objects or effects on the spot (creation). You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Conjuration magic.
   * Apportation. The branch of magic that deals with the transport of things and creatures, calling them from somewhere else or teleporting them away or from one place to another. This movement is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane, meaning that anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation. Apportation is also involved in the opening of dimensional gateways. This skill grants Expertise on checks like identifying where a portal might lead, or to deduce the origin of a transported object.
      * Calling (→ Dweomercraft). Refers to the practice of calling a supernatural entity into your workspace, usually under controlled conditions, for the purposes of bargaining with it for power, information or practical aid. Anyone who knows the right ritual (or something approximately right…) can get the target entity (or something similar) to pay them a visit. Doing so safely on the other hand usually requires extensive preparation and knowledge. This skill provides the knowledge to assess such rituals and make sure that they are complete, as well as knowing the right protective measures that would need to be in place before attempting a calling.
         * Bargain a Deal. You know how to leverage in making a deal with a creature from another plane and gain  Expertise on all such checks.


      * Planar Travel (trait). Knowledge of how to safely transition yourself and others from one existence to another, granting a higher degree of assurance to end up in the right place when crossing into the ethereal or across the astral planes.
         * Astral Travel. You know a lot about traversing the Astral Plane and have Expertise on all movement checks made there, as well as on check on knowledge on how to protect yourself in this place.


   * Creation (trait). The magic of creating objects from thin air. Temporary objects can be created from ectoplasm and given enough form to be useful, or an item can be pulled together from its component atoms and made literally from nothing. An item created this way is normally indistinguishable from an object created using mundane means. This skill allows you to deduce an item's origins.
      * Magic Crafter (→ Any craft, trait). Select a craft. You are both a skilled crafter as well as a skilled arcanist. Objects created by you are impossible to distinguish from a “normal” object to an investigator without the Creation skill, and even with it, they have disadvantage to detect any magic influences.


   * Familiarus (trait). Magic used to bind the life force of two creatures together as a master and familiar. You know the Call Familiar ritual, and if you start the game with this trait, you have one bound to you already.


   * Summoning. Summoning magic instantly brings a manifestation of a creature to a place you designate. It is temporarily removed from where it is summoned and appears under your control. When the spell ends, is dispelled or even if the summoned creature dies, it is instantly sent back to where it came from. This skill would allow you to recognize that a creature is summoned, and may even allow you to deduce how long time it will take until it is sent back where it came from.




* Divination. Magic which specializes in information gathering. Common applications include learning secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things and to foil deceptive magic. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Divination magic, as well as lore on how to protect against it.


   * Method of Divination. There are many divinatory techniques to specialize in (almost anything with "-mancy" on the end) based on everything from watching the sky for omens, staring into a fire, casting stones or seeing which pieces of grain a chicken eats. Some are described below. Unless otherwise noted for a form of divination, you can select one of the following types of readings that you can make for this method. You can select this skill again, choosing a different method to learn a new kind of reading.
   * You read the patterns for yourself or another person, preparing for an upcoming event. At any point from there on, the target can choose to gain advantage on any one roll. You can read the patterns for multiple targets, but as soon as one has changed the events (i.e. used the advantage), the patterns have changed and all other readings are now invalid.


   * You read the patterns for a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next week. The DM chooses from the following possible omens.
         * Weal, for good results
         * Woe, for bad results
         * Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
         * Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
The omen doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of spells or the loss or gain of a companion.


Arithmancy (→ Mathematics, trait). Utilizing mathematics and complex formulas, an arithmancer can see patterns in the future, using these portents to prepare for upcoming events and even ensure they happen.
Astrology. See the Astrology skill.
Other. See https.//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_divination for more examples.


   * Scrying (trait). Scrying magic uses an invisible magical sensor to send you information. Having this skill allows you to steer a scrying sensor with more skill. In addition to the basic movements and sensory acuity of the sensor, you can use your Stealth and Investigation skills through it.




* Enchantment. A term for those types of magic which control and manipulate the target's mind and/or take over control of their body. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Enchantment magic.
   * Charm. Your expertise is in charms and enthrallment, allowing you to recognize whether a person is acting under its own control or being influenced by someone. You would only be able to detect this for folk of your culture, as other folk and/or cultures may behave very differently from what you are used to, unless you have an appropriate skill in evaluating their behavior. To be able to assess a non-humanoid creature, you need an appropriate Nature or Animal handling skill.
   * Compulsion. This type of magic compels a target to to act in some manner or to follow some course of action, or inaction. By interviewing such a person you would be able to determine the limitations of a compulsion and, if possible, find a way around it.


* Evocation. Tapping into rawer elements of magic, evocation magic creates spontaneous and spectacular effects often without tangible form such as light or fire. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Evocation magic.


* Illusion. Focusing on deceiving and bending perceptions, illusion magics allow the user to present their version of reality to the viewer. They cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises or even manipulate light and shadow. The fae are famously fond of this sort of magic and are well known both for wrapping their true selves in it and for creating whole illusory environments (up to and including virtual food and drink). You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Illusion magic.


   * Figments (trait). Figment magic is the simplest interpretation of illusion magic, projected images lacking in any real substance that either move according to pre-programmed instructions or in accordance with the will of their controller. Anyone can see them, they look the same to everyone and they look as real as the creator can make them. If you have an appropriate knowledge on details of a creation, figments you create will look more real, giving disadvantage to disbelief; ex. Proficiency with Nature (beasts) to make a snarling tiger, Architecture to make a believable marble wall or Demonology for a horde of demonic creatures. In addition, having this skill and the connected skill grant Expertise on saves to see through a figment.


Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. Nor can a figment that includes audible effects duplicate intelligible speech.


   * Glamer (trait). This type of illusion magic changes a target's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear. With this skill you have the same benefits as described in the Figment section.


   * Pattern (trait). Like a figment, pattern magic creates an image that others can see, but its main purpose is to overwhelm the senses. With this skill you have Expertise on saves against pattern magic.


   * Phantasm (trait). These types of illusions exist only in the mind of the viewer, effectively tell the viewer's senses "there's a dragon here" and let them provide the balance of the information themselves. As it is all in a target’s head, a skilled illusionist can make the victim more susceptible to a phantasm by convincing them that something is happening. If you have proficiency with Deception, you can spend an action the round before casting the spell to force the target to roll its save with disadvantage.
      * Deadly Illusionist (trait). Your illusions invade the deepest crevice of your enemies’ minds and leave them scarred. If you are a spellcaster you learn one illusion spell from your class spell list. This spell does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. Creatures who fail their initial saving throw against one of your illusion spells of 1st level or higher take psychic damage equal to the spell’s level + your spellcasting ability modifier.


   * Shadow. Shadow magic creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions can have real effects. You have Expertise on all checks to recall lore on the Plane of Shadows and the magic emanating from it.


* Necromancy. The magic of life and death, the forces that stem from the innate magic of souls as well as the mending and manipulation of flesh, necromancy is seen as dark and dirty magic by most common folk. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with necromantic magic.
   * Osteomancy. Known as "bone magic", this focuses on the manipulation of the skeleton and the calcified remains of the living as well as the dead. Some uses of this skill would be to provide insight from skeletal remains, such as the type of creature, its condition in life or even what killed it. It can, if you are so inclined, allow you to select the strongest and most durable bones when creating skeletal creatures, granting them a +1 AC bonus.
      * Fight Skeletons (trait). You know where to strike a skeletal creature to hurt its integrity the most, granting you advantage on your damage rolls against them. In addition you can tell when such a creature has reached half its hp.


   * Incarneum. The returning of souls from beyond death. Such magic is viewed as heretical when not performed by clerics that channel the powers of their god, which is seen as having the blessing of both the keeper of the soul, and the soul itself. Doing so without divine guidance, i.e. using arcane magic, inevitably darkens the soul and gives rise to undead creatures that are trapped in an unlife of torment. This gives you theoretical knowledge on the workings of resurrection, souls and the nature of sentient undead.
      * Undead. This skill lets you identify sentient undead and may grant insight on how to combat creatures and how to put them to rest.
         * Battle Undead (trait). Provides +2 AC against sentient undead.
         * Exorcism. You have some knowledge in how to banish an undead manifestation with the use of proper exorcism tools. This is most commonly multiple holy symbols, but some undead may have other specific items that can drive them away. You can attempt to turn an incorporeal undead with an opposed skill check against the target’s Wisdom save. You cannot attempt to exorcize the same creature again until 24 hours have passed.
         * Vampire Knowledge. You are skilled in vampire lore. This grants Expertise on checks when speaking to them, as well a +2 bonus on saves against their innate abilities.


   * Pathogens. Some necromantic magic focuses on the manipulation of life in the form of diseases. You have  Expertise on checks to identify diseases and on checks concerning how to spread or cure disease.


   * Spiritualism. The contacting of souls from beyond death, often involving consulting the spirits of the dead about information they knew in life. This is sometimes seen as heretical, but in most cultures acceptable. In some cultures that practices ancestor worship or shamanism this could even be seen as something holy. This skill grants Expertise on checks to communicate to spirits.


* Transmutation. Transmutation magic changes the properties of creatures, objects or conditions. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Transmutation magic.
   * Detect Transmutation. The fact that an object or creature has been transmuted is normally impossible to detect with mundane means. In some cases even magic detection is not possible. This skill allows you to deduce that an item or creature does not have its original form. If you have an appropriate proficiency, such as Craft (blacksmith) when investigating a sword or Nature (beasts) when observing a squirrel, you have Expertise.


   * Constructs. This skill lets you identify constructs and may grant insight on how they were created, what their orders might be and how  to combat them.
      * Battle Golem (trait). Provides +2 to AC against golems and on saves against their innate abilities.


* Wild Magic. This type of magic is a field left alone by most serious arcanists, unless needing to handle problems caused by irresponsible casters. You have Expertise on checks to recall lore about phenomena associated with Wild magic. In addition, when rolling a wild surge on the wild surge table, you can use your reaction to reroll. You can do so before the results of the roll are revealed. (However, you can use subtle hints from the DM.) When you reroll this way, temporarily reduce your Luck ability score by 1.
   * Twist Luck. You have the ability to twist fate, avoiding the havoc you cause. Gain +2 Luck. In addition you can choose to have complete immunity to the effects of a wild surge after you know the effects by describing the improbable chain of effects leading to this. You can use this feature freely once between each long rest. Each additional time you use it, you permanently lose 2 Luck.


Architecture
The planning, designing and constructing of buildings and other structures, for the purpose of housing, defense, durability, beauty and other benefits. The field covers every aspect of architecture, including parts and pieces of domestic living, the building of castles and temples, decoration, the use of materials and town planning. However, this knowledge provides no practical skills related to building. Work that is proposed must therefore be hired out to others.


Examples of use.
Recognition of Style. Enables the identification of purpose, nature, period and probable culture of origin for an existing structure. You can also assess the relative comfort and social importance of a construction through sensory, emotional and intellectual means, recognizing the site’s social, cultural and beneficial merits.


* Construction. Integrates knowledge of surveying, excavation, masonry, carpentry, financial considerations, contracting and the ongoing management and productivity of labor. Some practical skills are included, but the focus is upon planning and overseeing work gangs who will perform the actual work.
   * Tradecraft. Grants knowledge of one craft to the architect, gained from time spent on building sites. Choose from carpentry, excavation, brickwork, masonry, tile work or thatching.
* Fortification. The art of designing defensive military fortifications such as walls, towers, harbors, mottes and baileys, gates, drawbridges and siege engines. The knowledge extends to making plans — for the most part, actual construction may take years and even decades, and can be performed by simple laborers under the guidance of skilled workers. This also includes a knowledge of how nature can be used to provide the most effective natural defenses.
* Investigate Structure. You are well familiar with the way architects add secret areas in a structure. This grants you Expertise when attempting to find secret doors and areas in a built structure, such as a building or dungeon.
Astronomy
Astronomy, which also includes astrology, is the observation of celestial objects both scientifically and as a means of insight into individuals and the natural world. The combined framework is possible in a world of magic, where astrology has legitimacy and is therefore respectable.


With this skill you recognize the constellation in the night sky, you would know about the existence of the solar system with its planets and you would always know which way is north as long as you can see the stars.


* Astrology. The monitoring of the movements of celestial bodies, both those bound to Golarion by anchors that appear as lights in the heavens that revolve around the night sky, and those further away that appear as distant stars. Such movements are the result of grand cosmological changes, showing the movements of the gods or their influences spreading to other planes. By rooting an object, and basing the movements of the heavens around it you can attempt to divine its future, mainly by ascertaining the relevant information from the astral calendar and doing some simple calculations around the person, event, or perceived outcome.


By spending a full night with clear sky, you can read the patterns for yourself or another person, preparing for an upcoming event. At any point from there on, the target can choose to gain advantage on any one roll. You can read the patterns for multiple targets, but as soon as one has changed the events (i.e. used the advantage), the patterns have changed and all other readings are now invalid.


* Navigation. Permits the proper use of a sextant in order to measure the angle between any two visible objects or to determine the character's location when the sky is clear, either by using the sun at noon or sighting the pole star at night. Position on the earth's surface cannot be obtained if a sextant cannot be employed. Useful navigation at sea can be managed very well if the character is also a sailor; otherwise, the character must relay the information to others capable of steering (the ability to navigate with a sextant does not add any skill towards piloting).


Cosmology
The study of planes of existence beyond the Prime Material. It provides details, including each plane's natural laws, moral code, reason for being and general extent. Knowledge of the outer planes focuses far more upon each plane's structure than it does upon its residents. This includes the planes' physical arrangement, the manner in which it is ruled and socially organized and the nature of its connection and relationship to the prime material. Such information would allow you the means to navigate such planes, interact with its residents accordingly and adopt a set of behaviors that would minimize conflict.


* Dweomercraft. This is the field of detection, understanding and manipulation of unnatural manifestations on the Prime Material plane originating from other planes of existence, such as demons, devils, elementals, celestials and the ancient creatures associated with the Cthulhu mythos. With this skill you have Expertise to recognize when a manifestation occurs and what's being witnessed.
   * Advanced Dweomercraft. You have considerable knowledge in this field. After identifying an unnatural manifestation you can attempt an Intelligence (Advanced Dweomercraft) check to gain some insight in how such a manifestation could be closed or sent back.
   * Call Manifestation. With this skill you know the proper protocols in how to address and speak to minor supernatural manifestations. It would for instance allow you to lure forth a manifestation known to reside in a location, permitting the suspension of hostilities while allowing communication.
   * Contact Other Plane. The knowledge of how to properly address the more powerful supernatural entities on their plane of existence, enables you to seek advice without being seen as a nuisance. It does not confer the ability to contact them.


* Knowledge - Plane (group). Each outer plane is its own skill granting more in-depth knowledge on this specific plane. You can take it multiple times, each time applied to a different outer plane. With this skill you have Expertise on Cosmology regarding the selected plane.
Courtier
The knowledge on how to properly behave in a court, from the minor court of a noble estate to an emperor’s court. You would know who you are “allowed” to address and how to do it in a way appropriate to their station, the correct way to gain an audience with someone and the different functions and titles used. This skill is mainly of use in human courts from your or a similar culture, unless you also have an appropriate Culture skill.


* Courtier II. You excel in the world of the courts and have Expertise on checks regarding lines of nobility or etiquette. In addition you have Synergy (Speechcraft) when interacting with nobility, common folk, or knights, provided that you have not shown yourself to be a danger to them.


* Courteous (cumulative, trait). Behaving in an appropriate way is the key in each situation. Gain +1 Charisma.


* Fey Courts. The courts of the archfey that rule the feywild have very specific rules. A slight mistake in how one presents a request or answers a question could have serious consequences.


* Heraldry. Relates to the implementation, creation, acquisition and origin of emblazoned signs and sigils upon tabards, shields, flags and so on. Signs are images that are blazoned onto armor and elsewhere according to complex rules in the formal language of heraldry. Identifying sigils includes seals, runes, glyphs or other emblems that can be recognized in relation to their state of origin, thaumaturgical school or magic form.


Each major culture is its own skill. This initially allows you to recognize and identify heraldic signs from your local area, as well as the motifs relating to monarchs, emperors or regional authorities of very high level (kingdoms within empires) within your chosen culture. This same ability extends to great religious leaders, patriarchs and archbishops and those who have established themselves as heroes through their deeds.


You have Expertise on checks to recall information about heraldry, lines of nobility or etiquette. You would be able to locate any such person's entourage or location moving with a host of soldiers or camped on the field from flags and other signifiers on display, or from the colors chosen for the individual's tent. The mark of any such individual on a document could be distinguished, as well as a seal or the stamp on a coin would be known.


* Recognition of Signs. Expands your knowledge to include the nobility of every kingdom or empire within the chosen culture, as well as signs relating to cities larger than 10,000 persons. You are also able to recognize the extensive collection of guild marks and signs created and displayed for public use. Finally, you are able to decipher all markers and signs that are intended to inform the public regarding access to the best routes (particularly those across frontiers), the best gates by which a city can be entered, as well as means to find superior eating houses, drinking houses, even brothels.
   * Recognition of Signs II. Permits recognition of heraldry, signs & sigils relating to secret societies, including thieves and assassins. These marks are used to indicate the location of secret places, warnings and even code words, which you can use to better navigate safely around large cities — where most signs of this type are located. Often, the signs themselves are concealed in places that only intended persons are supposed to know — under stones, on top of doors, within the pages of books and so on. On entering an area possessing a sign like this, there is a 4 in 6 chance the character will notice something "odd" about the place at once; and upon a few minutes reflection, will go right to the place where the mark is written and understand what it says.


* Politics. Continental politics are just so thrilling, with the upheaval and the betrayals and the drama of it all. Much better than any play you've seen or book you've read. You love keeping up with the political current events in a kingdom and always know what is going on with the ruler or officials of any country in the present day. Ancient history is a snoozefest and you don't care about a bunch of dead people, but for anything that is happening right now, you obsessively look for news and updates. You have Expertise on any check regarding information on current events, including how to gain the information you seek.
Culture
(Group)
Culture is a group of skills that involves the knowledge of other cultures (also known as anthropology), each skill being a different culture. You are always assumed to be proficient with your own culture. Skill with one Culture would not give you knowledge of any other culture. Each time you choose this skill, you must select a specific culture.


You know the basics about the customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art of a culture, allowing you to know what behaviors are acceptable. This can help you to get beyond any ethnic or racial divide, and to be treated warmly by other types of folk, provided you treat them in a similar manner. Proficiency with this skill allows you to treat other skills, like Courtier, History, Law and Religion, as if you belonged to that culture. The main known cultures in Golarion are.

History
The understanding of past events, conflicts and consequences arising from actions and chance occurrences. An Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars and lost civilizations.

This magic is mostly used by druids, rangers and creatures close to nature, such as fey. A Wisdom (Primal Magic) check measures your ability to recall lore about primal spells, symbols and magical traditions. It does not infer any knowledge on Arcane or Divine magic, with the exception of possibly knowing which category a phenomena might belong to.


Identifying A Spell
Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.


If the character perceives the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Wisdom (Primal Magic) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level.

* Break & Enter. Provides a character with some skill regarding the destruction of doors and windows so that they might be passed through as quickly as possible without creating excessive noise and attention. Glass may be cut, bolts in doors removed, stones and bits of plaster excavated, frames separated from the building itself and even boards and rivets removed from the doors themselves. The difficulty is not to succeed, but the time it will take, and how much noise is made. You have Expertise on all such checks.


A window may be cleared out enough to be safe to crawl through in 5 to 8 rounds, However, most windows, especially on the ground floor, are no more than 8 inches square and normally not large enough to squeeze through. Doors take longer. The bolts of a standard door can be dragged out in about 5-20 rounds, the die determining how “stuck” they are. A strong reinforced door may take anywhere from 60 to 90 rounds (10d4+50), to remove the rivets and bands of iron so that its bolts can then be dragged out. A “normal” dungeon door with bolts that are effectively cemented in place, will take three times as long (10d12+150 rounds) to loosen enough rivets so that wooden boards making the door can be wedged and the door taken apart piece by piece. Tools required include two sizes of chisel, three wedges, a small hammer and a pair of iron tongs.


* Case Building (trait). Provides a character with a unique eye regarding the design and layout not only of singular buildings, but of town and city blocks, street fronts and layout. Thus, a would-be thief may feel a particular property calls out to be entered, with conveniently placed balconies, ledges or rooftops easily accessible by rope and ladder.


Even though the probable location of kitchen, workshop, bedroom and internal stairwells often will be obvious regardless of the size of the building, a character should want to spend a week observing every detail of the building’s daily schedule. It is possible therefore to learn who lives there, who visits, who delivers, the usual time of departure and arrival, even what room persons are likely to be in at a given time of the day. Likewise, the passing of the sun will reveal the street itself, who is present, the lines of sight, hiding places, how shadows are cast at different times of day, and routes in and out of the neighborhood.


After such a thorough examination, the details can be planned; when and where to enter, if any temporary personas need to be created, escape plans etc. As long as the plan and routes are followed, each participant in the heist has advantage on Stealth checks, Charisma checks and checks required to escape.


* Detect Concealed Door. Enables a character to notice the telltale signs of a concealed door, then pinpoint its precise location. Concealed doors may be screened by trees, the shape of the terrain; they may be small and difficult to see; or located down a hole that passes unnoticed. Inside a house, they may be hidden by a curtain or covered by a rug. It is harder, however, to conceal evidence of traffic in and out of a concealed door. Footprints, a set of branches bent back in a particular way, loose rocks at the edge of a well, even the manner in which the corner of a curtain or rug may appear frayed or not quite straight. Additionally, there may be very slight tracks, or places where the floor or ground has been worn smooth, that will give the presence of a concealed door away. To detect such signs, make a Wisdom (Burglary) check, with Expertise.


If there is a concealed door and the character has seen signs, or has another reason to believe there is one, it will be found given enough time. Indoors, this will require merely 2-5 rounds. Outdoors, this will take longer — a total of 5-20 rounds.


* Lockpicking. You master the art of opening locks or circumventing security precautions of various designs using a set of lockpicks. You can additionally pick locks with improvised tools, but have Expertise on checks using proper lockpicking tools.


* Lookout. Enables a character to distract outsiders while another character commits burglary or other criminal activity, while also giving subtle warning to the perpetrator of the crime. This includes skill to ensure that they are not themselves noticed loitering around on a street, such as dressing up as a watchman, a beggar or a woman in distress (who will then ask for help from any passers-by, ensuring they are distracted). A skilled lookout will be very convincing, like an actor in a theatrical troupe. A lookout should also be ready to do whatever it takes to protect the burglar and help him or her get away — even to knock on the door of a residence that’s being robbed, if the inhabitants should awaken while the burglar is inside.


Signals of varying kinds are usually set up as warnings. a bird call, a bright flag or flash of light, calling out a fictional person’s name, as though the lookout were trying to find someone or the releasing of a trained animal. The lookout will absolutely be able to buy 2-8 rounds of attention from up to four persons with some contrived story or distraction. After those rounds of attention expire, successive Charisma (Burglary) checks will each buy another 2-8 rounds.


Cooking
The skill to prepare raw ingredients into tasty and safe meals. Normally no check is required. If you have the skill and ingredients, you can consistently prepare food that is edible and tastes fine, at least for people of your folk. Checks would only be required for example if you need to impress a gourmet or someone of a different folk with your cooking, if you want to cover up the taste of a poison or if you want to use something that might be poisonous if prepared wrong.


* Baking. You are skilled at the creation of flour-based food readied in an oven, including bread, cookies, cakes, pastries and pies, and have Expertise on such checks.
* Butchering. Skill at slaughtering, dressing and preserving meat from livestock, game and fish. A slaughter improperly performed can spoil or even poison the meat, so having skill at removing the animal's entrails is necessary in the production of large amounts of available meat. When preparing rations from animals, you can prepare 50% extra, and the rations will not spoil. You have Expertise on all such checks. However, normally you do not make checks for this skill, only required for instance if you need to extract a specific rare organ, such as a blowfish’s poison bladder or a dragon’s flame sac.
* Cuisine. The mastery of supervising and working in a professional kitchen, ordering and purchasing of inventory and the preparation, practice and preservation of food. It grants Expertise on Charisma checks when communicating with other kitchen staff, as well as patrons that have been impressed with your food. Note that these kinds of kitchens are only found in the courts of nobles and very rarely, also as restaurants.
* Foraging. The skill to find safe naturally occurring ingredients that you can prepare in a wilderness environment. Even though you might not be able to identify the exact nature of the ingredients, you will be able to ensure that they are safe to eat, and figure out how to prepare them. You have Expertise on all foraging checks and checks made to identify whether something is safe to eat or drink.


Herbalism
This skill is used to search for herbs in the wild, to identify herbs and to create herbal infusions.


Crafting Herbal Items. To craft a herbal item you need a herbalism kit and raw materials, either harvested by yourself or bought at half the value of the created item. When attempting to make an item, spend the raw materials and a long rest, then make an Intelligence (Herbalism) check and see the first applicable result below.


If the result of your check is 0 or lower. The item is not created, the raw materials are wasted and if using a herbalism kit, it is ruined.
On a result below 5 or if you roll a natural 1. The item is not created and the raw materials are wasted.
6-10. The raw materials were not as potent or fresh as you would have expected. You need to spend additional raw materials equal to 25% of the value of the created item, as well as 8 additional hours. If you choose not to, the original raw materials are wasted and the item is not created.
11-25. The item is created as expected.
Over 25. Exceptional potency. You can split the result into a double amount of doses.


You can make any number of doses of the same item at the same time. You can also make multiple different items simultaneously, but with a penalty of -2 per type of item. Make only one check which applies to all items. If you do not have a herbalism kit, you can improvise with other items, but have -4 on your check.


* Crafter. You are good at producing herbal items and have Expertise on all such checks.
* Identify Herbal Item (→ Sense-Taste). You can identify potions and other herbal substances by taste, granting Expertise on all such checks.

Some common Profession skills are baker, brewer, butcher, clerk, courtesan, driver, farmer, fisherman, gardener, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, midwife, miller, miner, porter, shepherd, stable master, soldier, trapper and woodcutter. In many cases there is an overlap between a Profession skill and other skills. The Profession skill is normally less specific and only includes the basic knowledge to perform the profession, as well as how to get in touch with potential employers or other similar professionals of your type, how to get hold of materials and tools or appraising the price and quality of services. In addition you have Synergy (Speechcraft) when interacting with other professionals or your type.

Sleight of Hand
Fine hand motor skill used for entertainment or deception. Used whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery. For example an action such as planting something on someone else, slipping something out of another person’s pocket or concealing an object on your person, would require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, while performing card tricks or other stage magic to entertain would be a Charisma (Sleight of Hand) check.

   * Glacier Crossing. Improves agility and success when crossing glaciers. You know what equipment is necessary and safe methods of crossing. With preparation you can grant your entire group Expertise on checks and saves against such natural hazards.


* Coastal Survival. You are an expert at reading coastal terrain, including areas around lakes and rivers, and can easily determine where the shallow sections are, as well as where the big lagoons or large ship anchorages might be. Additionally you have Expertise on Survival checks in that type of environment.
   * Fishing. You know the coastlines, but more importantly you are familiar with the fish that inhabit these areas and how to catch them. You can provide enough fish to feed yourself and five other people as long as the area has not been fished out. You can easily tell if something is disturbing the natural balance with the fish in a given area, but cannot necessarily identify the cause.

   * Caving. Enables the discovery of cave entrances by virtue of the experience gained from systematically searching rock formations, pushing through passages that are overlooked as "too tight," digging through dirt and rock fill, or enlarging narrow fissures in the rock — even recognizing air movement, the patterns of water seeping from rock or the tone of an echo. If a hidden entrance exists, characters with this skill are certain to find it; however, this does require half an hour of diligent searching over an area up to 30 ft diameter. Once that search is completed, the character will be able to say for certain that no hidden passage exists within a natural cave.


* Wetland Survival. You are at home in swamps and other types of wetlands, and have Expertise on Survival checks in that type of environment.


General Survival Skills
The following skills are applicable whatever the landscape or climate.


* Foraging. The skill to find naturally occurring food in a wilderness environment, which may be edible animal or vegetable matter. The exact nature of the food is not important, though it will typically consist of products such as fish, bird's eggs, roots, fruits and berries, nuts, honey, fungus, shellfish and more. The amount that is found will be far more than an ordinary person would find and will certainly be safe to eat. In addition you have Expertise on all foraging checks.
   * Identify Clean Water (trait). You can always ascertain if naturally occurring water is safe to drink, largely through observation, odor, testing a bit of the water against one's tongue and the appearance of the surrounding vista (no checks required).


* Pathfinding. Improves distance covered when crossing untracked wilderness. A proficient character can deduce the best way to go when attempting to cross a valley, desert or river, climb towards a mountain pass or to a high point, circumnavigate a large feature or otherwise avoid treacherous ground. This reduces the necessity for backtracking in order to find the best route through an untracked wilderness, saving travel time. A character with this skill improves the amount of distance traveled by 1/3.


An additional skill associated with pathfinding is the ability to identify a place — presuming it exists — where rest can be obtained in the wilderness. This will be a place with soft, dry ground, a minimum of dangerous wildlife, reasonably fresh water and retreat from harsh winds or exposure.
   * Pathfinding II (trait). Enables a character to help protect others from the environment, giving Expertise on checks against getting caught in or taking damage from natural features, such as sinkholes, slippery places, quicksand, natural pits, natural spikes and potential falls. In effect, character with this skill indicates the best possible route for others of less skill to follow, reducing the chance they will get themselves into trouble. A character with this ability is able to 'look after' one person per level — but note that the character himself must also be counted against the number to be protected if he wishes the benefit of the modifier. Otherwise, he will suffer from having paid too much attention to others.


* Scouting. A set of survival and orientation skills that focus on avoiding detection in the wild, providing a character with the skill to consciously avoid detection by others who may be actively hunting the character or in a position to witness traces left by the character. This includes actively choosing routes that won't reveal footprints, bending back grass and vegetation, selecting hard surface entry and exits onto trails, roads and river banks, to listen automatically for movement of others who may be moving in the area, a heightened awareness of wet environments, how to maintain one's equipment to leave the least scent, the presence of scent with regards to air movement and wind direction, etc. All of these things provide a negligible chance that the character, acting alone in the wilderness, will leave any track that will be noticed or remotely followed by a creature other than those gifted in tracking.


In addition, when you are moving at travel pace, you contribute your Perception to noticing threats even when you are engaged in another activity (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking).


* Tracking. The practice of observing, stalking and following a trail left by a creature or animal in the wild, in order to ultimately locate them or their lair. You have Expertise on such checks.


Swimming
You have the basic ability to swim.
* Armored Swimmer (trait). While wearing armor in water, you may treat it as a category lighter.

* Long Distance Swimming (trait). You are able to swim long distances without rest. Gain +1 Constitution.
* Speed Swimmer (trait). You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and can Dash while swimming.


Underworld
The familiarity with the criminal element and how to best handle oneself in rough quarters and among rough people, and knowledge of the unethical trade of other's property.


* Appraisal (trait). The skill to correctly identify the approximate value of items according to their workmanship and innate value. This would allow you to identify the most valuable objects in a room or treasure trove automatically, or to estimate the value of an object after examining for a few minutes.


* Black Market. The underground movement, illegal sale and fencing of stolen items, acting as a shadow house of sale for objects that cannot be sold to vendors or at auction due to their illegality. In the cities where you normally operate, no checks are required. You have one or more contacts that can handle these things for you. Finding contacts (safely) in new places requires a successful Charisma (Thievery) check. You have Expertise if it is within a Culture you are familiar with.


* Streetwise. You are aware of the subtle signs used in the criminal underworld, and can understand them enough to recognize who you can talk to, who you shouldn’t approach and how to ask for information with a minimal amount of trouble. You have Expertise on such checks if within a Culture you are familiar with. In addition you know Thieves’ cant.
* Fast Talk (trait). The criminal underworld is a dangerous place where a wrong word can get you killed. You know what to say and more importantly, what not to say. Gain +1 Charisma.


________________


Craft Skills
With a skill in this category you have enough knowledge to manufacture and repair objects of a certain type, provided you have the materials and tools required. However, this skill also cover other things related to your type of crafting skill, such as knowing how to get in touch with other crafters or a crafter’s guild, how to get hold of raw materials, appraising the price and quality of an objects and deducing where and how items of your type would be best sold or bought.


No matter your actual skill, in most cultures you would be considered an apprentice. During downtime in human urban and rural areas, this allows you to practice your profession in exchange for food, lodging and formal training in the craft, essentially allowing you to live a poor lifestyle without paying the cost.


Guilds. One thing to keep in mind is that crafting items and selling them in an area where there is a guild, is only allowed for master crafters. As an apprentice or journeyman you can be employed by a master or maybe help fixing minor stuff for people. Doing more than that could involve legal repercussions and other kinds of problems if found out. Note that this would only apply in areas where there are guilds, which is exclusively human urban and rural areas.


The following rules apply to all craft skills unless otherwise noted.
Crafting. In general, to craft an item you need the proper tools and raw materials worth half the listed value of the created item.  When attempting to craft an item, follow these steps.


Determine the final value of the item. This would normally be the listed market price, but a skilled crafter might want to display his craftsmanship and increase the final market value with any amount. During a full work day you make up to 10 gp of progress towards the final cost of the item, or 5 gp of progress if you work as a camp activity, i.e. spending half that in raw materials. Items do not have to be worked on during consecutive days.


At the end of a day’s work make a Wisdom (Craft) check and see the first applicable result below.


If the result of your check is 0 or lower. You messed up really bad. Today’s raw materials are wasted, as well as any progress you have made so far. You will have to start over.
On a natural 1. You find a flaw in the design. Today’s raw materials are wasted, and you have to readjust your plans. Choose one of the following.
* Continue working, but with -5 on all checks to craft this item until completed.
* Take some time to think about the problem. Instead of making progress and spending raw materials after each work day, make an Intelligence (Craft) check against DC 12. After a success you can continue your progress as before.
* Restart the project. Any progress made this far is wasted.
On a result below 5. Not a good day. Today’s raw materials are wasted and no progress is made.
6-10. Something goes wrong but you can still save today’s progress if you spend 20% extra materials. If you choose not to, today’s raw materials are wasted and no progress is made
11-24. Crafting is progressing as expected.
25 or more. A good day’s work. Choose one of the following.
* Spend only 50% of the raw materials for the same progress.
* You can spend raw materials and gain progress for two day’s work.
* Gain +5 on the next Craft check you make during the next week.
* If this is the final check during the crafting of an item, you can increase the final value by 10%.


Multiple characters can help cut the time down, with each person making a check and adding to the daily progress. This is contingent on those helping having an appropriate tool proficiency and that the item can allow for others to work on it (a crafting a ring won't have more than one person, while a whole suit of armor could use up to three).


For each craft, you can select the skills described below. Also note, that dwarves gain both the Journeyman crafter and Master crafter skills, as the craftsmanship of dwarves is well known. For other folk, during play, you do not have to spend points to gain the Journeyman crafter and Master crafter skills, instead you gain them as soon as you are applicable for them.


* Appraiser (trait). The skill to correctly identify the approximate value of items according to their workmanship and innate value. Your experience allows you to always know an approximate value after examining an object for a few minutes.


* Journeyman Crafter (trait). If you start play with this skill, you have an official trade certificate allowing you to charge for your work with the craft, but not yet work as a self-employed master craftsman. This will in most human urban and rural areas allow you to live a modest lifestyle without paying the cost. Becoming a Journeyman crafter during play is a lot harder, as it requires a 7 year apprenticeship. This doesn’t have to be cumulative, so you might almost be done during your background, and finish up the last periods during downtime.


As a journeyman one is expected to accomplish a three-year working trip, to train with multiple masters, which are called the journeyman years. After this trip a journeyman has to submit a masterpiece of work to a guild for evaluation. If the masterpiece is not accepted by the masters, he is not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of his life.


* Master Crafter (trait). If you start play with this skill, you are a member of a guild and have an official master certificate. This means you have a network of contacts within the craft, as well as suppliers, buyers and in some cases, with other related crafts. In most human urban and rural areas having this skill allows you to live a comfortable lifestyle without paying the cost.


* Trader. You know how and where to sell and buy the type of items you can craft in order to earn the most. This applies on transactions from single items to wholesale bulk. You have Expertise on all such checks, including checks made to find information about sellers and buyers.


The following skills are not bound to a craft, instead consider them as a single skill reachable from all types of crafts.
* Guild Politics. Knowledge of the etiquette among guilds and their associates. You have Expertise on Charisma checks when interacting with crafting professionals. This applies even to guilds where you are not a member.

Alchemy
The scientific study of the properties and behavior of the elements that make up matter; their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. The Alchemy skill covers theoretical knowledge of basic chemistry and can additionally be used to identify, appraise and safely use alchemical substances. You can safely craft basic alchemical items up to a value of 1 gp.


Crafting Alchemical Items. To craft an alchemical item you need at least an alchemist’s kit and raw materials worth half the value of the created item. Your skill determines what kind of alchemical items you can safely create.

On a result below 5 or if you roll a natural 1. The item is not created and the raw materials are wasted.
6-10. The reaction is not as efficient as you would have expected. You need to spend additional raw materials equal to 25% of the value of the created item, as well as 8 additional hours. If you choose not to, the original raw materials are wasted and the item is not created.
11-25. The item is created as expected.
Over 25. Exceptional potency. You can split the result into a double amount of doses.

With this skill you can make from simple bricks and roof tiles, to beautiful glazed art objects.


Many objects are formed on the potter's wheel, with a considerable amount of natural aesthetic included in the craft, as the natural color of the chosen clay is brought out by the firing process. However, the base ceramics skill focuses on shape, functionality and the behavior of clay material as it is modeled and fired.

* Advanced Kiting. A craft perfected by gnomes, where kites can be built large and strong enough to be able to carry a Small creature. A second creature still needs to fly the kite from the ground. Such a kite can also be used, even by a Medium creature, to glide down safely from a high position. A Dexterity (Advanced kiting) check is required to fly and land safely.
Leatherworking
(Group)
The making of products from animals, primarily including the tanning and processing of leather. Leatherworking consists of two very different steps. When you learn this skill, select one of the two subskills below. Even if you are not skilled in the other subskill, you still are aware of what is required to perform it, how to find someone who knows and theoretical knowledge of it, allowing you to make unskilled checks.


* Hides & Skins. The treatment and process underlying the transformation of skins and hides into leather, including skinning, tanning, tawing and parchment making.
   * Manufacture. You are skilled at the tanning and tawing steps of leatherworking, gaining Expertise on checks to craft leather from animal hides. This can be used to increase the value of the raw hides before becoming leather.
   * Parchment Making. Parchments can be made from animal hides, in a process that takes at least two week with optimal conditions. You can make parchments while traveling. This uses your camp activities, as well as some preparation before starting travel each day in order to allow different steps to be done on the road.

This might be an attack roll against you when you are low on hp, an unexpectedly high damage roll, a failed save against an ability damage or spell effect that instantly kills. When using it, the reroll is made with advantage or disadvantage, your choice. You can use this a number of times equal to the number of times you have died, and regain all uses when you finish a short rest.

Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.


Rank 3
* Arcing slash. When attacking with a two-handed sword, you may choose to target two creatures with a single attack. The targets must be within 5 ft of each other and within your reach. This attack uses the same attack roll for both targets, but using only half your proficiency bonus. On a hit you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier to each target.
* Versatile. In your hands, a Sword is a truly versatile weapon. When attacking during your turn, you can deal either bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage.


Rank 4
* Defensive Posture. After using the Attack action with a sword, you can spend a bonus action to bolster your defense. When you do, choose to either gain +1 to your AC, or lower the damage of one (1) attack that hits you by 1d6. Both effects last until the start of your next turn.
* Grinding Halt. Whenever you must make a Strength saving throw to avoid being moved against your will, you can dig the blade of your two-handed sword into the ground as a reaction. Roll 2d6 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. If the effect pushing you does not have a saving throw, you move 5 ft less instead.
* Pommel Strike. You may attempt to daze an enemy with the pommel of your blade. Make an attack as a bonus action. On a hit, you deal damage equal to your Strength modifier, and your target cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn.
* Short draw. As an attack, you may draw a sheathed one-handed sword and make an attack roll to strike the enemy with its pommel, leaving the target gasping for breath on a hit. The attack deals no damage, but the next attack roll made against the target has advantage. You must have at least one hand free to take this action.
Whip
Melee
A long, flexible, braided leather cord which tapered gradually from the handle to the tip. When stretched to full length, a whip can be up to 15  ft in length. The whip is mostly effective against unarmored creatures, but can be fitted with a blade at the end. All whips are martial weapons.


Rank 3
* Disarm. As an action, you may try to disarm a creature. If it fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (targets choice) against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the attribute you use for the weapon, it is disarmed.

* Whip Familiarity. Whips are considered light weapons for you.
Bow
Ranged
A bow is a shaft of strong, supple material with a string stretched between its two ends. It’s a projectile weapon that you use to fire arrows. Bows take training to use effectively, and they can be extremely deadly in expert hands.

Crossbow
Ranged
A crossbow is a weapon consisting of a bow mounted on a stock that shoots bolts. A mechanism in the stock holds the bow in its fully-drawn position until it is shot by releasing a trigger.

* Fast Loader. You have trained at loading crossbows faster, allowing you to ignore the loading quality of hand and light crossbows.
* Zig-Zag. At the start of your turn you can spend a bonus action to move up to half your base speed. Attacks you make during your turn are made with disadvantage, but ranged attacks against you are made with disadvantage until the start of your next round.
Sling
Ranged
Slings consist of a cord made from leather or fabric, with a pouch to hold a projectile. They are typically loaded with either smooth rounded stones or a ball of lead, known as sling bullets. However, unlike some projectiles they were very versatile and could be used to launch a variety of objects, such as rocks or coins. This group also includes the staff sling, which is a sling attached to a staff. It is held in both hands and can be used for heavier missiles.


Rank 3
* Sling Master. You may use either Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls, and when you score a critical hit using a sling, the target can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
* Headcrack. As an action, you may make a single ranged attack. If the attack hits, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of its next turn. A target can only be affected once by this attack, and this is reset after a short rest.
* Zig-Zag. At the start of your turn you can spend a bonus action to move up to half your base speed. Attacks you make during your turn are made with disadvantage, but ranged attacks against you are made with disadvantage until the start of your next round.
