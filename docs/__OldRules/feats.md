# Old feat rules

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. You can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

When you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from your class, you can also replace one feat with another feat, provided they both have the same ability score bonuses.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

A successful Insight check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.

-   ### Beautiful Coward
    You're always quick to shy away from danger, and desperate to keep your blood in its proper place, whether that takes covering your head and sobbing, "Dear god, don't hurt me!

    You develop your conversational skill to better deceive others.
    <br/>&dash; Increase your **Charisma** score by 1.
    <br/>&dash; You gain proficiency with the Deception skill. If already proficient, you gain advantage on all checks you make with it.
    <br/>&dash; When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to deceive one humanoid that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target’s Insight check. If your check succeeds, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks from the target and your attack rolls against it have advantage; both benefits last until the end of your next turn or until you use this ability on a different target. If your check fails, the target can’t be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.

When relieving Exhaustion this way, you take only 1 level at a time. If that condition has a save against its ongoing effect, you can immediately make a save against the effect to end it as part of taking the condition onto yourself. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you complete a long rest.

    <br/>&dash; You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion from extensive travel.
    <br/>&dash; You can cast *augury* without expending a spell slot as long as the question asked relates to a path, trail, or route, and only the consequences of taking it. The normal restrictions of using augury multiple times a day still applies.
    <br/>&dash; Little can stop you. As a ***bonus action*** you can gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus and be under the effect of *freedom of movement* until the end of your turn. Once you do this, you must complete a long rest before you use this feature again.

## <a name="magicBeginner">Magic feats</a> for beginners

Are you a non spellcaster and want to learn a spell or two? Or are you a caster with interest in a different type of magic? Then this section is for you.

<div class="columnsthree">

-   ### Ritual Caster
    *Prerequisite: Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher*<br/>

    You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.

    When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level ritual spells of your choice. Choose cleric, druid or wizard, and select your spells from that class’s spell list. The class you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

    If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical spell scroll or a wizard’s spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the spell list for the class you chose, the spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 1 hour per level of the spell, and costs 10 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
    <br/>&dash; Increase your **spellcasting ability** score by 1.

    You can select this feat multiple times.
