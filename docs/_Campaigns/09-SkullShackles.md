  *Crescent Moon (formerly Man's Promise)*<br/>
  *Date: From 10th of Rova, 4713 AR and onwards*

  After encountering some trouble on the high seas, our crew docked at Rickety Squibs to make some necessary repairs. It was there that we met Rickety Hake, who agreed to help us fix our ship as he had taken a liking to our crew. W assisted him with some giant wasps that had been causing trouble for his establishment. We investigated why the watchtower had not warned us about the wasps and discovered that the guard there had been attacked by the wasps.

  Gus, the Irori priest, joined our crew to help locate an adherent of Zon-Kuthon named Lexandro. This individual had stolen an artifact from his deity, implicating Iomedae in the process. Gus has been on the hunt for Lexandro for five years now and was sent by his master, Dalal, to keep an eye on things. We learned that the priests of Zon-Kuthon can find Lexandro, and the priests of Iomedae have the key to the location where he is hiding.

  Captain Merrill Pegsworthy, a friendly fellow we met while repairing our ship, found a Cheliax vessel and has pledged his allegiance to a member of the pirate council. He warned us about some members of the council who would attack any pirate flying their own flag and advised us to speak with Tessa Fairwind to swear our loyalty. She is currently located in Fort Peril, and we have been instructed to mention Captain Pegsworthy when we meet her.

  We also discovered an abandoned ship - a Ghost ship - which had been rammed on both sides, possibly by a monster such as a kraken. The captain's cabin contained a stone altar with symbols of Lolth, a spider demon goddess, and skulls were nailed to the ceiling. All the furniture had been destroyed and shoved against the walls with palm fronds. We found a small spider-shaped gemstone statue worth 50 gold pieces under the altar, along with some other loot.

  Our journey has taken us to Little Oppara, a town where the residents seem to think highly of themselves and their supposed cultural importance. We were able to open a magical safe that required a 100-gold piece fee, and inside, we found papers worth 10,000 gold pieces in Abadar post-vouchers. We will need to visit Port Peril to exchange them for their value.

  In summary, our journey has been eventful thus far, and we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of Lexandro and our goals as pirates.

  We discovered an island where Kibi and his companions were stranded. Kibi informed us that they were chased, their ship sunk and many were taken captive, including a person who knew about the Cyclopes. Kibi then led us to another island where the captors were located. We engaged with a group of guards and managed to defeat them.

  After defeating the guards, we searched the area and found a few interesting items. We found 63 gold, 63 silver, and 88 copper coins. We also discovered corroded copper gauntlets, which are not made of copper but a different alloy. A small axe head with runic inscriptions was also discovered. Kibi found a waterproof pair of knee-high boots made of sharkskin. A bronze shield with a faded green dragon head was also recovered, along with a damp and cracked iron helmet. Additionally, we found a book with loose pages containing strange language and pictures.

  While studying the book, I managed to decipher some of it, and it seems to contain information about Cyclopes. We also found a chest containing 800 gold coins and a leather sling with inscriptions that allows for teleportation.

  We have been sailing to a specific location marked on the map. During the voyage, Beyne spotted some creatures resembling merfolk under the boat. We were attacked by a small group of them at night but managed to defend ourselves successfully.

  We arrived at Zun K’thon Island and encountered heavy rainfall. We landed near a pier and a sunken ship, where we were attacked by skeletons rising from the sand. We discovered a two-pronged weapon that seems to indicate a direction towards Lexandros location. Beyleaf and the priest Odium and were the only survivors of the Zun K’thon encounter. We left Odium on Vezhnu and Beyleaf accompanied us.

  Overall, we have collected valuable artifacts and information. We are excited about what other discoveries we may uncover in our adventure.

  *Location: Cyclop Island*

  We arrived at a village on the outskirts of the island, which was divided into two distinct zones. The central region was a forest full of mushrooms that grew in the rain of acid. The outer part was a beach area. We came across an old road from the time of the cyclops that led into the mushroom forest.

  As we ventured deeper into the forest, we stumbled upon a ruined village. We took shelter in the first house we found and discovered an interesting mechanism. It was a wheel with a rune above it that said "closed" or something similar. When we turned the wheel, the rune changed to "way" or something like that. We heard a sound like a trap door opening somewhere in the distance.

  We heard strange ape-like noises coming from far away, which made us nervous. We proceeded to explore the area and discovered five god statues made of different materials. The first one was made of black stone, had six arms, horns, and a malevolent look, representing their evil god. The second statue was made of bronze and depicted a woman sitting in a cross-legged position. She had four arms and was holding a child and a cow. The third statue was made of burnt clay and had a crocodile head, a rough texture, and a large axe. The fourth statue, which was the worst of them all, was made of wood and had a woman's head with a bird-like appearance. The fifth statue was made of stone, had four arms, a gazelle head, and held a lightning bolt in one hand and a cloud in the other. Its lower hands held a plate.

  We encountered several doors, including one made of iron with a lock, one made of copper with a lightning trap, and one made of bronze. We also found several sarcophagi, including one belonging to King Talaharki of Madaroshanti, which we were warned not to disturb. The king was buried with his weapons, including a ring mail, a fancy helmet, and a two-handed sword. We also found a jar of magic-stopping salve, which contained eight doses. There was also a small copper bottle with a liquid inside, which Kibi identified as Potion of Vitality. This potion could cure any diseases or poisons and remove any exhaustion until the next long rest. We also found a large metal wand with a star on top and a container made from a human skull filled with a liquid.

  Kibi drew some pictures and notes in my book, which will be helpful in recalling our adventure. He's quite talented at drawing.

  We also found two water-breathing potions and a piece of cloth used to wrap the dead body. There was also a bottle of liquid that brought me back to life after I was killed.

  End log book entry.

- ### Logbook Entry - Sandara Quinn

  Location: En Route to Ollo

  Encountered a swarm of demons that attacked us and kept screaming "Find Achlon, Fetch Achlon". We fought back, and the crew managed to kill a fair amount of them. However, the violence was intense.

  Location: Ollo

  We met Hanelius Fitch, who offered to provide information on how to find the ship in exchange for a third of our treasure. He showed us a bone that belonged to Vargus Brach, a friend of his who was on the ship when it last sailed. Vargus had told Hanelius that they wouldn't be back for a while and that they had a lot of riches with them. The bone could be used to locate the ship.

  We learned that a pirate captain named Milksop Morton sails between Shark Island and The Smoker. He possesses a magical object, a ring, that can be used to locate a body if one has a part of it. Morton sails under Aginar Solinash and commands The Dryad's Grave.

  We are heading north towards Morton's location, and the doctor is accompanying us.

  That's all for now. Sandara Quinn, signing off.

  We arrived at the coast and found a clear hill with a single tree. According to our information, a Chelaxian is looking to procure truth serum. We decided to wait there, but not in too large a group.

  During our stay, we encountered some wreckers led by Lady Sting, and engaged in a battle which resulted in the death of Captain Wakarla, a half-orc wizard. We found some valuable loot, including a golden bee figurine, a magical stone tube with green dust, a spellbook, a locked box containing blue sand, a telescope, and 95 gold pieces. We also found a hidden cove where we can safely dock our ship.

  Our next stop was the House of Stolen Kisses, a Calistria temple where we met with High Priestess Dindrian. She informed us about a possible spy in Shackles named Jamies Keft, who is from Drenchport. Keft claims to know about the spies in Shackles and about the giant whirlpool near his hometown. He also mentioned a man named Giles Hamlis, to whom a poison was intended to be delivered.

  We contacted Sar'liss, a naga who knows about Keft's whereabouts. She asked us to help her regain her home, which was taken by her partner Mon'erej. She showed us a dead body of a man who had been lying there for at least a year. We found a pouch with 27 gold pieces and a coded message in the knots of a rope. We plan to decode the message with the help of Lucio's contacts.

  We asked the dead man, Varad, some questions, and learned that he came from Quent, his superior was Inglaf Tydo, and the poison was intended for Giles Hamlis. We plan to investigate this further and get to the bottom of this spy business.

  End of entry.

  Beachcomber proved to be a fruitful stop as we learned of a naga, Sar'liss, who may have information regarding a Chelaxian's search for a truth serum. We have been advised to wait at a clear hill with a solitary tree on the coast, with gemstones and mouse-filled crates as payment.

  Our search for the Lady Sting led us to the Wreckers, captained by the half-orc wizard Wakarla. As planned, we were attacked and Wakarla was killed in the ensuing battle. We did discover a magical tub of green dust that can be used to harm enemies, a spellbook, a locked chest containing blue sand that provides protection against evil, a telescope, and 95 gold pieces. The Wreckers have a hideout with cabins that they used to conceal their ship.

  Returning to Quent, we visited the House of Stolen Kisses, a temple of Calistra, and spoke with the high priestess, Dindrian. One of her priestesses heard of a man named Jamies Keft, a scrimshaw from Drenchport who claims to know about spies in the Shackles. Drenchport is the closest city to the giant vortex, which causes much rainfall and different weather patterns.

  We will continue our journey with caution and be on the lookout for any further leads on the truth serum and potential spies in the area.

  Today we met Sar'liss, the naga, who is trying to reclaim her home that was taken from her by her partner, Mon'erej. She doesn't want him dead, only punished. Her home is where the river splits, underwater to enter, but dry inside. She showed us a body of a man who tried to trade for naga venom, and it was clear he was not from around here. The man had been dead for at least a year and had a backpack and armor. A rotting purse with 27 GP was also found, originating from Sargava. The rope on the backpack has knots that make up a coded message, which Lucio can decode.

  We asked the body 5 questions. The body's name is Varad, and he comes from Quent. His superior is Inglaf Tydo, and the venom was meant for Giles Hamlis, a former soldier and assassin from Sargava who resides in northern Shackles.

  The coded message reads: "Go to snakes. Get venom. Get information. Deliver to captain. Diamond Star."

  Diamond Star was captured by the Hadonian fleet six months ago. A few months before she disappeared, the captain retired and was very young. Elise Farhaven is the captain who retired to Quent.

  We also learned about a man named Jamies Keft, a scrimshaw from Drenchport, who claims to know about spies in Shackles. He tells many lies and lives in Carver's Hall. The Master of the Gales, a druid and pirate captain, is the ruler of this island.

  Haddon Pike, a fisherman who lives outside of Drenchport, is rumored to be involved in smuggling. In his home, we found a humanoid wood-carved statuette, a bag of coins, and a music scroll case containing five pages of Chelaxian opera written in infernal. He was shot by two poisoned crossbow bolts, and we decoded the secret message ordering him to report on ships moving north, in, out, etc., particularly the Master of the Gales' ship. His contact is Roweena Kellet, who is in Hell Harbor on Devils Arches. There are many Gol'Ghan ruins on Devils Arches.

  Aronax Erdyium, a former Cheliax colonel who defected, is now in charge and has forbidden Chelaxians from entering. Roweena is the harbor manager.

  Tomorrow we'll head to Devils Arches to investigate.

  27 Desnus 4714

  We arrived at Hell Harbor and found out about Aronax Erdyium, a former Chelaxian Colonel who has banned Chelaxians from the area. He still has his Chelaxian warship and Roweena, who manages the harbor, has been missing for about two weeks now.

  While investigating Roweena's office, we found a hidden book with a list of pirate captains in the council, along with some numbers next to their names. Tessa's name had a figure of 100,000, while Aronax had only a dash. Those who are known to be unreliable have lower numbers, while those who stand up for Shackles have higher ones. The note mentioned something about sending with Corlan.

  We met Corlan, a Kenku smuggler, but he was assassinated by Giles when we told him about the bird statue and Haddon Pike's death. Giles had a small jar of ointment, a metal bottle of viscous alcohol, and a leather pouch with beans and runes on the outside. We found a message on him with three names, Haddon Pike, Roweena Kellet, and Corlen, and it instructed to use the supplied dose on each and return to the apothecary in Port Peril for payment. Destroying the message was also mentioned.

  Gualternus also died in the confrontation with Giles, and we need to be more careful from now on. We have to find out more about these names and their connection with the toxin. This could be a dangerous situation for the Shackles, and we need to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible.
