# Cursed

*Highway robbers await in the cliffside of a canyon pass. One of them spots a figure in the distance. As he draws near, he seems to be some sort of scholar, or perhaps a priest. It is no matter; he is clearly not experienced in combat. And he’s travelling alone.*

*The band of thieves rush into the pass. Their misfortunate victim tries to run, but he is quickly cornered. As one bandit swings his mace, the man raises his open hand and halts it with a force much more powerful than would befit his frail frame.*

*His eyes flash with a green glare, and his skin begins to bubble. The now wary bandits slowly shuffle backwards. The man shoots to well over 8 feet tall and his flesh ripples as it adjusts to a new muscular form. As the bandits turn tail, the monster hurls a nearby boulder and bellows a thunderous roar.*

You are cursed. The body that you inhabit is shared with something else. It might be an incorporeal, fiendish presence that takes control when your mental defenses are down, an unearthly entity from beyond that warps your body to better suit it, a curse that transform you into a furious wolfman, or even a manifestation of your own inner rage.

### Life of Solitude
A curse has many facets, and few are particularly pleasant. Yet, worst of all, the body has a mind of its own, infected by the curse. It acts as according to instinct, and the only way to truly accept your power is to let it take control of you. To be the creature that others fear, to fight like a savage animal, tearing down friend and foe alike. To live with this knowledge should be unbearable, and yet the cursed carries on down their dark path, hoping against hope for relief from their fate. Or that the burden may become easier to bear one day.

Those few unlucky ones to be afflicted by a dark, twisted transmutation magic tend to lead isolated lives. Their unpredictable and dangerous alter ego makes them a pariah, so they avoid cities whenever possible. Although they do tend to frequent libraries, as their lonely lifestyle has led them to confide in books. These tortured souls are often well learned and otfen turn to magic as it might lead to apossible cure.

Some seek this power out for themselves, empowered by mystical rituals, unnatural science, or otherworldly forces. but not all of these individuals are beholden to their base desires and many turn their frightful power into a force of good.

</div>

As Cursed, you gain the following class features

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:**   1d6

#### Proficiencies
**Weapons:**   Simple weapons

**Saving Throws:**   Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:**          Arcana

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- a dagger and any one simple weapon
- *(a)* a explorer's pack or *(b)* a scholar’s pack
- one set of tools you are proficient with

### Cantrips
Through meditation and the use of arcane formulas, you draw power from your curse, and can use some of its power in your normal form. You learn two cantrips of your choice from your spell list. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for those cantrips.

You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cursed table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned with another cantrip from your spell list.

### Cursed Form
Choose a curse, which describes the form of your alter ego, and the source or your power. Curses are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

One thing that all curses have in common is the ability to let your monstrous passenger surface. The Cursed form is a terrifying sight to behold. It has a mind of its own, but just as you share bodies, you also inhabit the same mind, allowing you to nudge it in the right direction. This gives a modicum of control, just enough to not attack allies and to steer the monster in the right direction.

As an ***action*** you can transform into the Cursed form. Your size is now medium if it was not before, and your weight doubles. When this happens, any nonmagical equipment that does not fit your new form is possibly destroyed. Magic equipment that does not fit, will be merged into the new form, but will be unusable. If you are affected by the grappled or restrained conditions when you transform, they immediately end.

Unless otherwise noted in the specific curse descriptions, the following applies when you are in your Cursed Form:

<div class="cursedcols">

* In addition to wardrobe malfunctions, your stats change. When changing form each physical ability score and its associated saving throw (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) is exchanged with a mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma).
  You may change which physical ability is changed to which mental ability when changing form. You make this choice at level 1 and cannot change this later.

* Your **base armor class** is now equal to 10 + your new Constitution modifier + your new Dexterity modifier.

* Your current and maximum **hit points** are both set to your original maximum hit points, but modified by your new Constitution modifier. If your hit points reach 0, you instead return your current and maximum hit points to what you had before you transformed, and then you revert back to your normal form at the start of your next turn.

* You have **resistance** to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and ignore the effects of exhaustion.

* You have advantage on **Strength** checks and saving throws.

* You have **disadvantage** on checks and saving throws for the ability that you have selected to exchange Strength for.

* You cannot cast spells or concentrate on them.

* You **lose any proficiencies** you have in your normal form (including weapons), but gain proficiency with Athletics, Intimidation and all melee weapons, including improvised and natural weapons.

</div>


While entering your Cursed Form requires an ***action***, ending it early requires only a ***bonus action***. Left to its own course, the Cursed Form will last for a number of minutes equal to your level.

Once you have changed form a number of times equal to your proficieny bonus, you must finish a long rest before you can change again.

<div class="card rest">
<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Long rest |
|:-|
| After a Long rest: |
| * Regain all uses of your ***Cursed Form***.
| * Regain use of ***Hard to Kill***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Ritual Casting
You can inscribe magical rituals in a Ritual book. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list. The spells are written in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Ritual book in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your book. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your Cursed level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 10 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

### Spellcasting
The search for a cure of your affliction has made you pour through many arcane tomes. Together with the meditative techniques and mantras you use to calm your inner beast, you have committed some of the formulas you have found to memory. This allows you to memorize and cast arcane spells.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier**  = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Spell Slots
The class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Cursed spell list. The Spells Known column of the class table shows when you learn more spells from your class spell list. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you known and replace it with another spell from your spell list.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your spells.

### Split Personality
The Cursed form has a will of its own. As you are two minds in one body, it helps you to resist mind altering effects. From 2nd level, you may add your Cursed form’s ability modifier (minimum of 1) to all saving throws against being charmed, frightened, stunned and knocked unconscious.

If you fail such a saving throw, make a Wisdom save with a DC equal to 10 + half your Cursed level. On a failed save, the cursed form takes over, without spending one of your daily uses. It will not be affected by whatever triggered the save, but it is out of your control, making you unable to end the transformation early.

If the duration of the triggering effect still remains when the transformation ends, you are still affected by it.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, whenever you are in your Cursed Form, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Two Minds
Also from 5th level, you have resistance to psychic damage in both forms.

### Feral Instinct
By 7th level, you have become twitchy with fear and/or anticipation. You have reflexes like lightning. As such, you now get advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can use a ***reaction*** to start changing into your Cursed Form, allowing you to start with that form on your first turn.

### Quick Transformation
From 9th level, you have begun to embrace the power granted by your inner monster. You can use a ***bonus action*** instead of an action to use unleash your Cursed form.

### Hard to Kill
From 11th level, your involuntary companion can take over when you’re on the brink of death. If you drop to 0 hit points while in normal form and don’t die outright, you automatically change into your Cursed Form. You are unable to end the transformation early by your own will, and when it ends, you are stable at 0 hp, but gain one level of exhaustion. When you have lost control like this once, it will not happen until after you completed a long rest.

### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 13th level, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with an attack while in Cursed Form.

This increases to two additional dice at 17th level.

### Large Size
At 15th level, the curse's might is manifesting itself in physical size. Your Cursed Form is now large, and your its weight is triple that of your normal form. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has more information on creature sizes.

### Indomitable Might
Beginning at 18th level, and while in your Cursed Form, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use the score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
At 20th level, begin to embrace your dark side, rather than fight it. While in your Cursed Form, your Strength and Constitution scores and maximums increase by 4.

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-cursed-forms">Cursed Forms</a>

Your curse is defined by the being that has taken hold of you and shares your mind with you.

At 1st level, chooses the curse that shapes your other form. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **<a href="#internal-alchemical">Alchemical Curse</a>** - Your repressed rage, your primal urges, or the darkness that you try to hide has taken on a personality of its own through dark alchemical experiments.

- **<a href="#internal-chosen">Chosen</a>** - Your mortal body has been inhabited by a celestial creature, like an angel. Most people say that it’s a blessing, that you are chosen and that you should feel honored. But no one asked you. Your body was just taken into possession without your consent. To you this is a curse.

- **<a href="#internal-beyond">Curse from Beyond</a>** - They say that when gazing into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Your interest into the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, was what caused this. Your experimentation with the arcane, with summoning circles, astronomy and mind expanding drugs made your mind an easy target. Something came through; something mysterious whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality, maybe even a sliver of an Elder god. Whatever it was, its motives are incomprehensible to mortals.

- **<a href="#internal-demonic">Demonic Possession</a>** - Maybe a summoning went wrong, maybe a cursed item was inhabited by the demonic creature, or maybe you even did this voluntarily to try wrest the powers from a fiend. Now you share your body with a demon, a creature bent on mayhem and destruction

- **<a href="#internal-entropicRift">Entropic Rift</a>** - Your cursed form is not a creature at all. By some cosmic happenstance, an improbable space-time collision or maybe because of a simple wild surge, a piece on entropy now resides in you.

- **<a href="#internal-lycanthropic">Lycanthropic Curse</a>** - You are filled with animalistic fury and cursed with lycanthropy that changes you into a beast when the full moon hangs high in the sky.

- **<a href="#internal-molded">Molded</a>** - You have been infected with an intelligent ooze, which has slowly made you loose your cohesion.

- **<a href="#internal-sealedDragon">Sealed Dragon</a>** - The sealed dragon curse is not like the others. The cursed form is your original form, and you have been sealed away inside an inferior human body. At times you can release a fraction of your previous might, but mostly you are trapped.

- **<a href="#internal-shadowcursed">Shadowcursed</a>** - You have a constant shadowy presence following you; a spirit, a ghost or a shadow. It could be a vengeful relative’s spirit, the remaining vestige of forgotten deity, a tainted totem spirit, or the remnant of a ghostly sentience that once dwelt in a cursed house but has instead moved onto you.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-alchemical">Alchemical Curse</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Cursed Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 1st | Alchemist, Monstrous Rage |
| 3rd | Alchemical Serum, Hurl Creature, Stable Form |
| 6th | Implacable Rage, Long Throw |
| 10th | Increasing Might |
| 14th | Preternatural Vigor |

</div>

You may have been an alchemist, studying the possibility to make a person stronger and more resilient through mutagenic potions. But your mutagen had to be tested, and you chose to test on yourself. That was the first time you transformed into a hulking abomination.

Maybe you have been subjected to a cruel ordeal that changed you forever. A necromancer, dark cultist, or other practitioner of foul blasphemies subjected you to wicked experiments that changed your fundamental nature. Though you escaped the tormentor who sought to transform you into a mindless henchman, lasting effects remain.

In either case, you have a part of yourself that wants to escape. Your repressed rage, your primal urges, or the darkness that you try to hide. It takes on a personality of its own, and sometimes it breaks free.

### Alchemist
You have proficiency with Alchemy. This might even be the reason why you are cursed.

### Monstrous Rage
Your cursed form is a monstrous, larger and powerful form of you, totally consumed by rage and other strong emotions. It might have changed some much that there is no resemblance between your forms, or it could be that the two forms are clearly the same person. The other form is still you in a way, but a foul shadow defined by the worst elements of your soul that makes a mockery of your ideals. Select an extra Flaw that is only in effect when you are transformed.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed form:

<div class="cursedcols">

* Your mind is filled with pure emotion, granting you **advantage on all Wisdom saving throws**.

* When **striking** with your fists in your Cursed form, you deal 1d6 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. Any one-handed improvised weapon deals d8 damage if wood, or d10 if stone or metal. If the object is so large it has to be lifted in two hands, increase the damage die one step. When within 5 feet of an unattended item that can be used as a weapon, you can pick it up as a part of an Attack, as long as you have a free hand.

* During a move, you can shove a creature as a ***bonus action***.

* You are proficient with **throwing things** not usually meant to be thrown. You can treat any item that you can hold in one hand as if they had the Thrown property with a range of 15/30, and attack with using a ***bonus action***.

* Being adjacent to a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls with thrown weapons.

</div>

### Alchemical Serum
You might hate your alter ego, but the urge to transform is like an addiction. Sometimes you need the release of your other self, and sometimes there are obstacles that only your cursed form can handle.

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/85/0d/13/850d133d01f17895ac50104180f2fcf2.png' style='float:right;width:30%;padding:20px' />

From 3rd level, using alchemists's supplies you can brew a serum that allows you to initiate the transformation yourself. Preparing this serum takes 8 hours, and you can brew and carry at most such 6 vials.

As an ***action*** you can spend a spell slot of any level to infuse the serum and drink it, which triggers your change without spending a Cursed form use.

### Hurl Creature
At 3rd level, you master throwing other creatures. While grappling a creature your size or smaller, you can use an ***action*** to throw them at a creature or location, with a range of 10/20. The thrown creature falls prone after landing and a targeted creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against DC 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. The effects of the throw depend on the size of the thrown creature.

**Tiny**. The thrown creature takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier. A targeted creature takes damage equal to twice your Strength modifier on a failure, and none on a success.

**Small**. The thrown creature takes damage equal to 1d12 plus your Strength modifier. A targeted creature takes damage equal to 1d12 plus your twice your Strength modifier, or half as much on a success.

**Medium**. The thrown creature takes damage equal to 1d10 plus your Strength modifier. A targeted creature takes damage equal to 1d10 plus twice your Strength modifier, or half as much on a success.

**Large**. Exactly as above, save that all creatures within 5 feet of the target location or creature must also make a saving throw. Larger creatures function identically, and only improve the size of the impact area by 5 feet per size category above Large.

All damage dealt is bludgeoning damage. If you throw a willing creature, it must make a DC 10 Acrobatics check or fall prone when they land. If the willing creature is not thrown at a target, a successful save also negates the damage.

### Stable Form
Your body resists all attempts to change it further. From 3rd level, you have expertise on  saving throws against spells and effects that would alter your shape, in both your forms.

### Implacable Rage
From 6th level, your inhuman form heals itself when it suffers a grievous blow. Once per transformation to your Cursed form, when you take damage, as a ***reaction*** before taking the damage, you can instantly regain heal hit points equal to twice your Cursed level.

### Long Throw
Also at 6th level, the range of weapons thrown by your Cursed form increases to 30/60.

Additionally, you can throw any object bigger and heavier than a handaxe but smaller and lighter than a maul up to 300 feet, though you can't aim with precision and can only choose a 10ft square where the object will land. Objects thrown for these distances do not deal damage on impact.

You can throw a grappling hook or other object with a rope attached up to 200ft.

### Increasing Might
Starting at 10th level, you can throw a creature one size larger than you with the Hurl creature ability, but the range is decreased by half. You can also double the distance you shove a creature in your Cursed form and shove it in any horizontal direction that isn't directly behind you.

You can shove a creature up to one size larger than you, but only directly forward. A creature that is two or more sizes smaller than you can be shoved in any direction.

### Preternatural Vigor
At 14th level, your raging Cursed form can shrug off effects that would stop normal mortals in their tracks. You have expertise with Constitution and Strength saving throws in that form.

<hr class="classdivider">

| 1st | Angelic Being |
| 3rd | Innate Spellcasting |
| 6th | All Seeing |
| 10th | Judgement |
| 14th | Magic Resistance |

</div>

Your mortal body has been inhabited by a celestial creature, like an angel. Most people say that it’s a blessing, that you are chosen and that you should feel honored. But no one asked you. Your body was just taken into possession without your consent. To you this is a curse.

### Angelic Being
Your cursed form is a shining angel. It is a beautiful androgynous humanoid, with feathered wings, a golden breastplate and a two-handed sword of radiance.

As a side effect of the origin of your Cursed form, spells affect you as if you were a celestial in both your forms.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  You can see in complete darkness up to 60 ft, and can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language that you can see, up to 120 ft away.

*  You have resistance to radiant damage, and are immune to charm and fear.

*  The golden breastplate grants a base AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier.

*  With your transformation, you manifest a shining sword that deals radiant damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier. If the sword leaves your hands it immediately disappears, but you can summon it back as an ***item action***.

*  The wings grant a flying speed of twice your walking speed. To use this flight, you cannot be encumbered. For the wings to be able to function, you must have a number of feet equal to your height free on both sides of you.

</div>

### Innate Spellcasting
From 3rd level, while in your Cursed form, you can cast the following spells at will, requiring only verbal components: *detect evil and good*, *protection from evil and good*, and *shield of faith*.

### All Seeing
Starting at 6th level, you have *truesight* up to 30 ft in both your forms.

### Judgement
From at 10th level you can unleash judgement on all creatures with 60 ft radius once per transformation. For each creature in the area, choose harm or heal. Unless behind full cover, a creature harmed takes 4d8 + your Constitution modifier radiant damage, while a healed creature is healed the same amount, as well as freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

### Magic Resistance
Beginning at 14th level you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects in both your forms.

| 1st | Abomination |
| 3rd | Immutable Form |
| 6th | Iron Will |
| 10th | Aberration Telepathy |
| 14th | Portal to the Beyond |

</div>

They say that when gazing into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Your interest into the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, was what caused this. Your experimentation with the arcane, with summoning circles, astronomy and mind expanding drugs made your mind an easy target. Something came through; something mysterious whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality, maybe even a sliver of an Elder god. Whatever it was, its motives are incomprehensible to mortals.

### Abomination
Your cursed form is a frightening abomination, maybe with many eyes and/or mouths, and certainly tentacles, lots of tentacles. The actual process of transformation is a very disturbing sight. It could be a tentacled being forcing its way out from your mouth, leaving a shriveled husk behind, or something expanding from within, shredding your skin while slicing its way to freedom.

Creatures that are not accustomed to such a display of gore, must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier when they see this, or be frightened of you for 1 minute. Fiends, aberrations, undead, construct, (and maybe your allies after the first couple of times) are not affected.  A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.

When you select this Cursed form at 1st level, select two Mutations listed at the end of the Curse description.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  You have resistance to acid and poison damage.

*  You gain a tentacle slap attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier.

*  Additionally you have access to all Mutations that you have selected.

</div>

### Immutable form
From 3rd level, your constant body changes makes you have more control of your body. You become immune to any spell or effect that would change your form, unless you specifically allow it. If you fail a save against such an effect, you can choose to ignore it, or change into your other form. This is in addition to your normal daily transformations.

You may also select a new Mutation, and change one that you already have.

### Iron Will
You’ve slowly adjusted to the terrors you have seen, and those that you become. At 6th level, you gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws in both your forms, and have advantage on saving throws against fear.

You may also select a new Mutation, and change one that you already have.

### Aberration telepathy
Your otherworldly nature allows you to warp with another’s mind. From 10th level you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. You can use this in both human and Cursed form.

You may also select a new Mutation, and change one that you already have.

### Portal to the beyond
At 14th level, other creatures from the Far realm has found you malleable body, and try to use it to crawl their way into your world. The creatures try to shape you into their image and inhabit your shell. As an ***action*** you can change into an random abomination with CR equal to half your level or lower (GM has the creature statistics). The shape will be theirs, but this is your world, and your will is stronger...it has to be.

When you change, and at the end of each of your turns, make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 5 + the CR of the aberration. If you succeed you are in control of your body and mind, and do not have to roll for control any more. If you fail, the creature has full control, and will act however it sees fit. Otherwise treat is as the *polymorph* spell.

## Mutations
Unless otherwise noted, the following features apply in Cursed form only. Whenever an ability requires a target to make a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

#### Aberrant eyes
You have eyes or eye stalks all over your body. This grants you darkvision up to 30 ft, immunity to sneak attack and advantage on Perception checks and saves against effects that would blind you. However you have disadvantage against gaze attacks.

#### Acidic Bile
As an ***action***, you spew acid in a 15 foot cone. Prior to unleashing the bile, you can charge it as a ***bonus action*** on each of your turns for up to a number of turns equal to your Constitution modifier. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, they take 1d6 acid damage + an additional 1d6 damage for each time you charged it. On a success, they take half of that. The initial damage increases by on die, and both the initial and charging damage increase by one die size when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.

#### Adhesive
Your whole body is covered by sticky fire resistant slime. You have resistance to fire damage. A creature grappled by you has disadvantage when trying to escape your grapple. In addition you can stick on any surface, allowing you to move across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Amorphous
The Cursed form is more like an ooze. It has resistance to falling damage, can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, has tremorsense up to 60 ft and is immune to the prone condition. In addition you have advantage on checks and saves made to avoid and escape grapple.

#### Devour Mind
Once per round, when you hit a creature with a tentacle slap, you can also devour a part of their mind, deal psychic damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier. You may add the same amount as temporary hit points. This ability does not work on mindless creatures, like most constructs and some undead.

#### Engulf
As an ***action*** you can try to engulf a creature of your size or smaller. The target makes a Dexterity save. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of you. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, you enter the creature's space, it takes 1d8 acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature is restrained, and takes 1d8 acid damage at the start of each of your turns.

When you move, the engulfed creature moves with you. At the end of each of its rounds, the engulfed creature can try to escape by making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the DC. On a success, the creature escapes.

#### Gibbering
Your cursed form has constantly and incoherently babbling mouths and maws all over its body. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of you and can hear your babbling must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls for the action during their turn as if under the effect of the *confusion* spell. You can suppress this at will, but it requires concentration to do so.

When a creature is confused this way, you can use a ***bonus action*** on your turn to blast its mind, dealing 2d8 + Constitution modifier, or half that if the target succeeds at a Intelligence save.

A creature that has succeeded with its save, is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

#### Grappling tentacles
Your Cursed form has tentacles long enough to wrap around creatures. When you tentacle slap a creature, no more than one size larger than you, you can attempt to grapple them as a bonus action. At the beginning of your turn, if a creature is grappled, you can squeeze them for the same damage you deal on a tentacle slap. You can still use your other tentacles to attack (only) other targets during your turn. The number of creatures you can grapple simultaneously is equal to you Strength modifier.

#### Melt foe
Whenever one of your acid attacks kills a creature, you can choose to dissolve it. If you do, and the creature is of CR 1 or higher, it will melt into a puddle of goo. At the end of your next turn it will quiver and animate as a gray ooze under your Cursed form’s control. Roll its own initiative after it has animated. You can control a number of oozes equal to your Constitution modifier, but lose control when you change into your normal form.

#### Mind Blast
Once per transformation you can emit psychic energy in a cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Intelligence saving throw or take damage equal to 2d10 + your Cursed level, or half this amount if it succeeds on the saving throw. A creature that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round.

#### Oozing flesh
Pulsating cavities all over your body constantly ooze acid. At the beginning of your turn, any creature grappling or being grappled by you takes 1d8 acid damage.

#### Reactive body chemistry
Your cursed form is immune to the poisoned condition, acid and poison damage. Your normal form is also somewhat affected by this, gaining resistance against acid and poison damage.

#### Stench
Your putrid presence forces creatures that start their turn within 5 feet of you to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of for 1 hour. You are immune to all similar effects from other creatures in both your forms.

#### Toxic Blood
When a creature deals piercing, or slashing damage to you, each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity save or take acid damage equal to your Constitution modifier. Additionally, you gain immunity to the poison condition and poison damage in both forms.

#### Venom
Your Cursed form has a stinger, bite attack, a hooked tentacle or some other way to inject venom. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make an attack with this weapon as a bonus action, dealing 1d8 + Constitution modifier poison damage. This counts as a magical venom.

</div>

Not all beings in our world are benevolent. All planes are inhabited by malicious fiends, undead, evil deities, and aberrations of forgotten gods. These beings seek footholds in the material to expand their reach. They inhabit mortal forms to perform their deeds, whether those people do so willingly or not.

Maybe this was a summoning gone wrong, maybe cursed item was inhabited by the demonic creature, or maybe you even did this voluntarily to try wrest the powers from the fiend. Now you share your body with a demon, a creature bent on mayhem and destruction.

### Demonic Form
Your cursed form is a twisted demonic creature that is alway inside youS. pells affect you as if you were a fiend in both your forms.

When you gain your Demonic form at 1st level, select one of the demonic aspects listed at the end of the Curse description. Unless otherwise noted, the aspect apply in Cursed form only.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  You have resistance to cold, fire and lightning damage.

*  You are immune to poison damage and the poison condition.

*  The power of your cantrips come from this fiend, and it can access them as easily as you do. Your cursed form can cast all cantrips that you know, but uses Constitution as its spellcasting ability.

*  You gain a claw attack that deals slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier.

*  The chosen demonic aspect grants additional features.

</div>

### Demonic Might
From 3rd level, while in your Cursed form, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one melee attack as a bonus action.

### Already possessed
You are already possessed, and there is no more room in your mind. From 6th level you are immune to possession and charm effects. You may still trigger the Split personality feature if you are targeted with a charm spell or similar.

### Teleport
Beginning at 10th level, instead of moving the conventional way in your Cursed form, you can teleport up to a number of feet equal to your movement, to an unoccupied space you can see.

### Magic Resistance
From 14th level you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects in both your forms.

## Aspects
The aspect describes the powers of the demon inhabiting your mind. Aspects have the following in common:

**Saves**. Whenever an ability requires a target to make a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

**Aura**. The demonic form has an aura extending in a 5 feet radius, affecting all creatures in the area, except you. The radius increases to 10 feet at 6th level, and 15 feet at 14th level. The aura instantly turned on at its maximum radius when you change form. As a bonus action you can increase or decrease the radius by 5 ft, down to 0 or up to the maximum.

 The effect of the aura is triggered when first created, and when a creature first enters the aura. A creature starting its turn inside the aura may attempt a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they are immune to the effects of the aura from this particular transformation.

### Aspect of Cold
**Cold aura**.  A creature in this chilling aura cannot make reactions and has its movement halved. Whenever a creature affected by the aura is dealt cold damage, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls, Dexterity saves and ability checks until the end of its next turn. In addition, reduce all fire damage dealt within the aura to half.

**Icy claws**. You can imbue your claws with chilling cold as a bonus action, making them deal magic cold damage instead of slashing damage. This lasts until you turn it off by using a bonus action.

**Frostbite**. Once per transformation you can dramatically lower the temperature in an area up to 60 ft radius. Everything in that area will be covered with ice and frost, making it difficult terrain for 1 minute. Hostile creatures within the area must make a Constitution save. A creature that fails its saving throw takes a number of d10s cold damage equal to half your Cursed level (rounded up) and becomes frozen in place for 1 minute; restrained and unable to take reactions. Affected creatures can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

### Aspect of Fire
**Fire aura**.  At the start of your turn, each affected creature takes 1d6 fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches you or hits you with an unarmed attack takes 1d6 fire damage, even if unaffected by the aura. In addition, reduce all cold damage dealt within the aura to half.

**Fiery claws**.  You can turn you claws into flame as a ***bonus action***, making them deal magic fire damage instead of slashing damage. This lasts until you turn it off by using a bonus action.

**Fire blast**.  Once per transformation you can emit a sphere of abyssal flames from your body. Each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cursed level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

### Aspect of Mind
**Aura**.  Chaotic images and thoughts assault affected creatures within your aura, causing them to be confused. When a creature rolls for its random behavior, you may use a reaction to reroll the d10.

**Mind assault**.  Whenever you take the Attack action, you may simultaneously assault the targets’ mind with basal emotions. As a ***bonus action***, force a creature you physically attacked during your turn to make a Wisdom save. If target fails, it takes 1d8 + your Constitution modifier psychic damage, and you may select one of the following effects, that last until the end of its next turn:


<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

 **Fear**: Target is frightened of you.

 **Pleasure**: Target is torn between the pleasure of pain and its sense of self-preservation. Bludgeoning, piercing and slashing melee attacks have advantage against it.

 **Rage**: Target will do whatever it takes to hurt you, even if it means it has to go through lava, or his allies.

 **Apathy**: Target will avoid attacking, or doing anything except defending itself, but is  immune to the frightened and charmed conditions.

 **Insanity**: Target is affected by confusion.

 <br/>A target affected by one of the conditions cannot be affected by that particular effect again during this transformation, but can still take the psychic damage.

</div>

**Mind blast**.  One per transformation you can emit a psionic blast in a 30 foot radius around yourself. Hostile creatures within that area must succeed at an Intelligence saving throw or take a number of d8s psychic damage equal to half your Cursed level (rounded up) and be stunned until the end of your next turn. A successful saving throw halves the damage and does not not stun.

### Aspect of Rot
**Fetid Cloud**.  A miasma of disgusting green gas extends out from you. It spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. Affected creatures are poisoned, and while poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this effect.

**Infected claws**.  When you damage a creature with your infected claws, the injury is infected for as long as you concentrate. As a ***bonus action*** you can deal 1d8 necrotic damage to all creatures in sight with an infected injury.

**Abyssal spores**.  Once per transformation you can breathe out a cloud of deadly spores that instantly spread into a 30 ft radius around you before becoming inert. A hostile creature in the area takes a number of d10s necrotic damage equal to half your Cursed level (rounded up). A successful Constitution save halves this damage.

 If one or more beasts or humanoids that are Small or Medium dies from the spores, you can use your reaction to animate them, causing them to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creatures use the zombie statistics and remains animate for as long you have your Demonic form, after which time they collapse and die. The maximum number of creatures you can animate is equal to your Cursed level.

<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| After a Long rest: |
| * Regain use of ***Surgeproof***.
| &nbsp;
| Add the following class specific benefits to choose from: |
| * Regain use of ***Spellmeister***.
| * Regain use of ***Share your Curse***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Your cursed form is not a creature at all. By some cosmic happenstance, an improbable space-time collision or maybe because of a simple wild surge, a piece on entropy now resides in you. It periodically opens a rift between here and the wild entropy of Limbo, with you as its anchor point. When this happens, you are shunted to a pocket dimension within Limbo, while in your place remains a multicolored shimmering light.

### Chaos Rift
Your cursed form is not a creature, but a stationary, translucent rift in space. The rift is mindless, and thus immune to psychic damage and conditions that require a mind. Even though mindless, it has a few remnants of your identity left, enough to recognize allies and foes.

While in your Cursed form, your original form (i.e. you) is safe somewhere else, not affected by what is happening in this plane. When you return, you can choose to keep any temporary effects affecting only you. For example, if the rift was affected by the spell *blink*, you get to keep the remaining duration on your original body when you return. If the effect requires concentration, you can continue to keep that.


While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  The rift's attack is something random ejected from the rift. Choose a target and roll on the table below for damage type. The damage equals 1d8 + your Constitution modifier. This is a ranged spell attack, with 30 feet range, using your Constitution modifier to hit. The attack does not have disadvantage when there is an adjacent enemy.

    | d10 | Damage Type | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | :-: | :---------- | :-: | :---------- |
    | 1	| Thunder       | 6	| Bludgeoning
    | 2	| Acid          | 7	| Piercing
    | 3	| Cold          | 8	| Slashing
    | 4	| Fire          | 9	| Necrotic
    | 5	| Lightning     | 10 | Radiant

*  The rift cannot move. It sheds bright multicolored light in a radius equal to what would have been your walking speed. However, as an ***action*** the rift can blink and open up at another point within the light. When it does, it results in a wild surge with itself as the caster and all adjacent creatures as targets.

</div>

### Entropic Shield
From 3rd level the Chaos rift can protect itself with a chaotic shield. As a ***reaction*** when targeted by a single target attack in your Cursed form, you can manifest a protective shield between you and the attacker. Roll on the following table:

| d20 | Effect |
| :-: | :----- |
| 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 | The attack is unfortunately drawn to you, hitting you automatically. No attack roll necessary.
| 6&nbsp;-&nbsp;9	| The chaotic manifestation was completely useless against this attack. The attack is not affected. Roll attack as normal.
| 10&nbsp;-&nbsp;14	| The attack is partly repelled, but not strong enough. The attack is made with disadvantage.
| 15&nbsp;-&nbsp;19	| If the attack is magic, it surges. If it is non magic, it turns into a random energy, then surges.
| 20 | The attack is redirected back at the attacker. Make an attack roll as if the attacker made it.

After each transformation some energy remains, allowing you to use this feature once in your normal form, until the start of your next long rest.

### Nudge
Starting at 6th level, you can nudge the strands of chaos just a little bit. When you roll damage type for your rift's attack, you can add or subtract 1 from the d10. If you do not, the attack counts as magical. If your result is lower than 1 or higher than 10, the attack surges instead.

You can also affect spells cast in your normal form if a spell requires some random roll, such as the *chaos orb* and *confusion* spells. When several rolls are made, only one dice can be affected per spell. However, for those spells you cannot go outside the table.

### Spellmeister
Beginning at 10th level you can cast every known spell in the multiverse. Unfortunately you cannot control which of all those spells you cast. As an ***action***, target a creature, who will be the target of a completely random spell. The GM has a list to roll from.

If you use this feature in your normal form and target an enemy, you roll two random spells, and the GM will choose the most appropriate one. As a rule of thumb, an offensive spell will be chosen before a neutral one, and a beneficial chosen last.

If you use this feature in your Cursed form and target an ally, you also roll two random spells, and the GM will choose the most appropriate one. The rule of thumb is the opposite (beneficial, neutral, and offensive last).

In both cases a lower level spell will be chosen over a higher level. You can use this feature once in each form, and this use recovers when you finish a long rest.

### Surgeproof
It’s a chaotic world, and sometimes even you have to admit that your curse can be a blessing. From 10th level, as a ***reaction*** when affected by a wild surge while in your normal form, your Cursed form can absorb the chaos.

You can choose this after you know the effect of the wild surge, but before any specifics of the surge has been rolled/resolved. When you use this feature, your involuntary companion switches places with you and absorbs the effects for you only. As a “payment”, the Cursed form will not allow you to end the transformation early.

When you have lost control like this once, it can not be triggered until after you completed a long rest.

### Share your Curse
From 14th level you can unleash a massive burst of chaotic energy as an ***action*** in your normal form, letting others feel just a tiny fraction of the curse you constantly bear within you.

All creatures within a 30 feet radius must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, their ties to causality are disrupted. Whenever the creature takes an action, they must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. This disruption lasts until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature once and you can recover the use when you finish a long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-lycanthropic">Lycanthropic Curse</a></h1>

You are filled with animalistic fury and cursed with lycanthropy that changes you into a beast when the full moon hangs high in the sky.

One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire, features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.

Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in beast form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.

### Lycanthropic Form feature
At 6th and 10th level, you gain a feature specific to your selected lycanthropic form.

### Survivor
From 14th level, your wounds heal faster in your lycanthropic form. At the start of each of your turns, if you have less that half your maximum hit points, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Lycanthropic Forms
Select one of the following animal-humanoid hybrids.

### Bear Form
Werebears are powerful lycanthropes with the ability to temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine form's fur provided they can grow hair. When a werebear transforms, it grows to enormous size, lashing out with weapons or claws and fighting with the ferocity of a bear.

#### Ursine Toughness
At 10th level, while in your lycanthropic form, and not wearing armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.

### Boar Form
Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their hybrid forms they use heavy weapons, or a devastating goring attack.

In both your forms, you gain proficiency with improvised weapons. In addition, weapons with the Heavy property no longer impose disadvantage on attack rolls if your size is Small.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Lycanthropic Form:

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

*  Your AC when in this form is 12 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier and your size becomes Medium.

*  When you successfully hit a creature with your tusks on your turn you may use your ***bonus action*** to attempt to push the creature back. The creature must succeed with a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier or be pushed 10 feet away from you.

#### Relentless
When you reach the 10th Level, if you drop to 0 hit points while in your any form and don't die outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can do this once per transformation.

### Rat Form
Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In both humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.

The lycanthropic curse in your blood makes you immune to all diseases, in both your forms.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Lycanthropic Form:



<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

*  Your size becomes Small.

Its hybrid form is more terrifying by far - a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.

</div>

You have been infected with an intelligent ooze. At first it just lived inside your body, among your organs, but slowly it started to replace your inner anatomy. You are not sure how you can still function, as your insides were slowly replaced. It came as a shock, the first time your entire body collapsed into a pile of ooze, totally outside your control. You realized that maybe you were not you anymore, and your whole body had been replaced by a slimy body snatcher. With sheer willpower you pulled yourself together.

Now the lines have blurred, and you do not know who or what you really are, man or ooze. You feel like yourself most of the time, solid as you should, but at times you lose cohesion and you are not so certain anymore.

### Ooze form
When you transform into your Cursed form your body melts into a brightly colored ooze. In both forms you count as both humanoid and ooze.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed Form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  Being amorphous, you are able to move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

*  You can extend powerful pseudopods to attach adjacent targets. Your pseudopods deal 1d6 damage + your Strength modifier, and you can choose to have them deal bludgeoning or piercing damage.

*  When you use the Attack action with a pseudopod or simple weapon, you can make one pseudopod attack as a ***bonus action***.

*  You gain 30 feet blindsight and are immune to the blinded condition.

### Ooze Companion
At 3rd level, you can release a part of you that can accompany you on your adventures as an ooze companion. Choose an ooze from one of the oozes listed at the end of this class description. The companion recognizes both your forms as its master. You add your proficiency bonus to the ooze’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point number in its stat block equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your class level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.

The ooze obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can command the ooze where to move (no action required by you). You can use your ***action*** to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengaged, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the ooze to take the Attack action. Commands need to be either verbal, or if within 30 ft from you, telepathic.

When you cast a spell targeting yourself in your normal form, you can also affect your ooze companion with the spell if it is within 30 ft of you.

If you are incapacitated or absent, the ooze acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The ooze never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

If the ooze dies, you can create a new companion after your next long rest.

### Crawling Chaos
Starting at 6th level, your Cursed form gains a climb speed that is the same as your walk speed, and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

In addition, while in ooze form, you can use your ***bonus action*** to change your outer colors to match your surroundings. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface such as a rock or wall that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain advantage to all checks when hiding, as long as you remain there without moving.

### Trained companion
Beginning at 6th level, on any of your turns when your ooze companion doesn’t attack, you can use a ***bonus action*** to command the ooze to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help on its turn.








### Pseudopod Fury
At 10th level, you can use your ***action*** to make a pseudopod attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

In addition, when you command your ooze companion to take the Attack action, the ooze can make two attacks.

### Slime Sight
At 14th level, you gain blindsight out to 30 ft and immunity to the blinded condition in *both* your forms.

### Growing Ooze
At 15th level, when you gain the Large size class feature, your base armor class is now equal to 13 + your new Constitution modifier + your new Dexterity modifier, and your pseudopod attacks use 2d6 for damage instead of 1d6.

***Ooze Cube***. The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 11 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

***Engulf***. The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures’ spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space and the creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-sealedDragon">Sealed Dragon</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Cursed Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 1st | Dragon Type, Draconic Form |
| 3rd | Frightful Presence |
| 6th | Indomitable Will |
| 10th | Wings of Flight |
| 14th | Superior Species |

</div>

The sealed dragon curse is not like the others. The cursed form is your original form, and you have been sealed away inside an inferior human body. At times you can release a fraction of your previous might, but mostly you are trapped.

Born to be the most powerful race in the multiverse, sealed dragons are wyrms that are trapped in mortal forms that may or may not forever hold them hostage. These sealed dragons are one of many but the most common are the ones that were kidnapped during their wyrmling period, where a dragon is not yet of great power. It is uncommon and rare for an older dragon to be sealed but Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon has been known to mete out punishments similar to this.

With an infinitely strong body and constantly growing power, dragons are revered as mortal gods capable of shaking the very foundations of a world once they grow powerful enough. Sealed dragons follow the same pattern but in quick bursts. While sealed, their power grows far more quicker than a normal dragon but this has a limit and most dragons that are cursed with being sealed die quick. This is due to lack of adapting. After all, dragons never once adapted to anything, everything else adapts to them.


### Dragon Type
Before you were cursed with a weaker and frail mortal frame, you were once a part of the mightiest race to walk the multiverse and this power still resonates with you even in your most weakest state. Beginning at 1st level when you take this class, you choose one of the true dragons as your true form. This choice will determine many things as you level.

| Dragon | Damage type | Breath weapon |
| :----- | :---------- | :------------ |
| Black | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line
| Blue | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line
| Brass | Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line
| Bronze | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line
| Сорper | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line
| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone
| Green | Poison | 15 ft. cone
| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone
| Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone
| White	| Cold | 15 ft. cone



### Draconic Form
Your Cursed form is a weakened form of your original body. It’s a small draconic form, but just as fierce. You have wings, but they are not strong enough to carry you. When you transform into your Draconic form, your mind stays with you, so you have access to all proficiencies you have in your normal form.

Since you have the same mind in both your forms, the Split personality feature does not apply to you, but, you are able to cast spells in both your forms.

For the purposes of spells and magical effects, you count as dragon and humanoid, in both your forms. You gain resistance to your draconic species' damage type in both forms. In addition you can speak, read, and write Draconic.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed Form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  You gain a claw attack that deals 1d6 + Strength modifier slashing damage.

*  Whenever you attack only with your claws, you can also make a bite or tail attack as a ***bonus action***, for 1d8 + Strength modifier piercing damage, or bludgeoning damage respectively.

*  You can use a breath weapon based as an ***action*** once per transformation. This breath weapon targets all creatures as listed in the Dragon type table. Targets must make a Dexterity saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, or a Constitution saving throw if your damage type is cold or poison. If a creature fails this saving throw, it takes damage equal to 2d10 + your Cursed level, or half this amount if it succeeds on the saving throw. At level 6, your line breath weapons increase its length by 15 feet and cone breath weapons become a 20 feet cone. At level 10, your line breath weapons increase its length by 30 feet and cone breath weapons become a 30 feet cone.

</div>

### Frightful Presence
From 3rd level, while in your Draconic form, as an ***action*** you may level your draconic gaze at a creature within 60 feet of you. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for one minute. A creature affected by this repeats this save at the end of each of its turns, and a creature that saves against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.








### Indomitable Will
Your will to return to your superior form aches throughout your whole body, rejecting any obstacle and weakness that will prevent you from reaching your true state. From level 6, once per transformation when you fail a saving throw, you can reroll the die once and must use the new roll.

### Wings of Flight
Your wings are finally strong enough to carry you. At 10th level, your wings will allow you to fly. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.



### Superior Species
Even closer to your release final release, your abilities strengthen.
 * Your breath weapon damage doubles to 4d10 + twice your Cursed level.

 * Frightful presence affects all creatures within range simultaneously.

 * Your flying speed increases to double your walking speed.

 * As an attack action, you can attack twice with your claws, and once each with your bite and tail.

</div>
</div>

</div>

You have a constant shadowy presence following you; a spirit, a ghost or a shadow. It could be a vengeful relative’s spirit, the remaining vestige of forgotten deity, a tainted totem spirit, or the remnant of a ghostly sentience that once dwelt in a cursed house but has instead moved onto you. Whatever it is, it is now a part of you, and you know you will never be free of it.  It cannot be heard, with the exception of the whispers only heard by you, slowly pushing you to more heinous deeds.

Your companion is a ghostly being that exists in the ethereal plane, following your everywhere, mirroring your every move. It keeps itself interposed on your body, A creature that is able to see into the ethereal plane will see it, but barely, since it inhabits the same place as you. The reason it chose you might be as simple as you two being the exact same dimensions, making you an ideal hiding place.

### The Shadow Within
Your Cursed form is a ghostly being, with the same size as you, but with a terrible, twisted visage. When you “transform”, you are shunted into the ethereal plane, while your presence takes your place in the material plane. You see everything that happens, but you are powerless, unable to affect events unfolding. Now you are the whispers in the mind of your constant companion.

This means all your equipment follows you to the ethereal plane with your body, Nothing is destroyed, but nothing can be used by the Cursed form, nor your allies.

While transformed, the following applies in addition to the benefits of your Cursed Form:

<div class="cursedcols">

*  The Cursed form has a physical body that weighs 1/10 of your original weight, but has an unearthly strength, making it more than capable of destroying its (and your) enemies.

*  It is undead and not humanoid, so some spells and effects will not work on it (like most charm spells). However, its connection to your living essence grants it advantage on saves against effects that specifically target undead.

*  It has resistance to all nonmagical damage, except psychic and radiant.

*  The Cursed form can attack unarmed, dealing 1 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and 1d6 necrotic damage, or with an icy stare at a target within 30 ft, dealing 1d8 cold damage if the target fails a Constitution save against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The necrotic and cold damage both increase by one die size when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.

</div>

### Suspicious Thoughts
Beginning at 3rd level, you can better harness the hateful vigilance of the shadow that accompanies you, as it warns of possible threats and casts its suspicions on the motives of those you meet. You add your Constitution modifier to all Initiative, Insight and Perception checks. This applies to both forms.

### Ghost Step
Starting at 6th level, your shadowy presence can partially pull you into the Ethereal Plane. As an ***action***, you can turn ethereal until the end of your next turn. While ethereal, you have resistance to all damage, except for psychic damage, and you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you are occupying the same space as a creature or object when this effect ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy, and take 1d10 psychic damage for every 5 feet that you moved. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you take a short rest.

Your Cursed form can do this at will. When it moves through a creature, it can choose to deal 1d10 psychic damage on the creature and itself.

### Terrifying Visage
From 10th level, as an ***action***, the Cursed form can terrify others with its visage. Each non-undead enemy within 60 feet that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, or be frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is paralyzed for 1 minute as well. A frightened or paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending both conditions on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or either effect ends for it, the target is immune to your terrifying visage for the next 24 hours.

Additionally, when in your normal form, you can take on the terrifying visage of your patron as an ***action***, with the same effects. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you take a long rest.

### Against the Shadow
Starting at 14th level, your long fight against the shadow blackening your thoughts grants you a powerful defense against attempts to influence your mind. You gain proficiency with Charisma saves, you are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, and you have advantage on all saving throws against enchantment spells.
