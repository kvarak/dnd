# Barbarian

Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian’s driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.

> *"The rage that lies within the soul of a barbarian can take many forms. It can be summoned equally with a sense of purpose, a fire of passion, or a cold vengeance. Regardless of its source, a dreaded fate awaits any who stands in its path"*
>
> -- Garin Tristane, general

### Primal Path
At 1st level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. All paths are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a **bonus action**. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

You can rage for a maximum number of rounds as your remaining **Fury**. The rage ends if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t made any aggressive actions since your last turn. You can also end your rage as a **bonus action**.

When the rage ends, reduce your current **Fury** with the number of rounds you raged for. The maximum fury for your barbarian level is shown in the **Fury** column of the Barbarian table.

*See the Barbarian Rest Additions for more details.*

</div>
</div>
</div>



### Unarmored Defense
While not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Combat Style
At 2nd level you can choose one of the following options: *Cleaving Blow*, *Heightened Reflexes* or *Reckless Attack*.

***Cleaving Blow***:
When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack, you can target another creature adjacent of the original target and also within your weapon's reach; if your original attack roll would also hit the second creature, any excess damage from the attack is applied to that creature.

***Heightened Reflexes***:
While raging, you gain an additional reaction, but you can't use both of your reactions on the same trigger.

***Reckless Attack***:
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Survivor
Also at 2nd level you gain 3 additional skill points to spend on Perception and Survival.

<!--
At 2nd level you can choose one of the following two options: *Danger Sense* or *Survival Instincts*.

***Danger Sense***:
You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


***Survival Instincts***:
You have learnt how to survive in the wilds and gain two of the following skills: Breaking things (doors, bars, etc.), Feats of strength (lifting things, toppling wagons, etc.), Perception, Surviving in the wilds or Tracking.

Additionally you always have advantage with those skill.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Mobile
At 4th level you gain 2 additional skill points to spend on Acrobatics *(only Parkour)*, Physique *(only Climb X, Fast movement, Jumper, Sprinter)* and Swimming

<!--
At 4th level you can choose one of the following options: *Fast Movement*, *Hunter's grace*, *Instinctive Pounce* and *Unstoppable*.

***Fast Movement***:
Your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

***Hunter's Grace***:
Physical obstacles can’t hold you back. You gain climb and swimming speed equal to your walking speed while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

***Instinctive Pounce***:
When a creature ends its turn within 15 feet of you, you can use your **reaction** to move up to half your speed to a space closer to the creature and make a single melee weapon attack with advantage. The enemy you attack using this feature has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.

***Unstoppable***:
Your foes have no chance to escape you. You always add your proficiency bonus to ability checks made when moving (climbing, swimming etc.) or moving past physical obstacles.
-->

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you are almost impossible to surprise. You gain the *Perception - Keen awareness* skill. If you have that skill already, you may spend a skill point on any other skill.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.

*See the Barbarian Rest Additions for more details.*

### Rage Power
At 15th and 18th level you can choose one of the following options: *Clarity of Mind*, *Indomitable Might* or *Unstoppable Power*.

***Clarity of Mind***:
When you fail a Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw while raging, you can use your **reaction** to automatically succeed.

***Indomitable Might***:
During rage, if your total for a Strength check or Strength save is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

***Unstoppable Power***:
While in your rage, you have advantage on all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

### Primal Champion
At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores, and maximums increase by 4.





<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-primal-paths">Primal Paths</a></h2>

Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, or a gift of a totem animal.

At 1st level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **<a href="#internal-aquaticHunter">Path of the Aquatic Hunter</a>** - This path is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. Barbarians from coastal and island cultures often draw on the spirit of the ocean's creatures to inspire them in battle.

- **<a href="#internal-berserker">Path of the Berserker</a>** - The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

- **<a href="#internal-courageousHeart">Path of the Courageous Heart</a>** - An intrepid do-gooder, whose impromptu effectiveness in battle isn’t due to anger but rather matching pluck, tenacity, or stubbornness to shrug off the worst the enemy has to offer.

- **<a href="#internal-defender">Path of the Defender</a>** - Barbarian that has assumed the responsibility of safekeeping a bondmate. This can be people of importance, like a traveling priest, a tribe's shaman or elder, and so on, but just as often they simply form a bond with someone they either care for or share a common goal with, like a sibling or fellow adventurer.

- **<a href="#internal-hurler">Path of the Hurler</a>** - Some barbarians follow this path for the simplistic and primal joy of seeing a thrown axe or hammer smash the skull of their quarry. But why stop there when you can throw logs, rocks or even enemies.

- **<a href="#internal-juggernaut">Path of the Juggernaut</a>** - These barbarians are an unstoppable force on the battlefield.

- **<a href="#internal-paintedWarrior">Path of the Painted Warrior</a>** - Barbarians of this primal path use their own bodies as a canvas, displaying their artistic talent and connection with their tattoos to the world.

- **<a href="#internal-sacrifice">Path of the Sacrifice</a>** - Everyone dies, but your death was written in the stars themselves. You are going to die, and your death is going to mean something. You scream with rage because your life means more than just an ending. When the time comes, you will be waiting, bloodstained weapon in hand.

- **<a href="#internal-totemWarrior">Path of the Totem Warrior</a>** - The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration.

- **<a href="#internal-warChief">Path of the War Chief</a>** - Leaders and warrior kings who can turn any scrappy group of companions into a tight-knit tribe. Inspiring their allies to victory with battle cries and war songs, war chiefs lead every battle from the frontline.

</div>

The Path of the Aquatic Hunter is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

Barbarians from coastal and island cultures often draw on the spirit of the ocean's greatest hunters to inspire them in battle. Aquatic totems include killer whales (orca) and sharks.

<img src='http://tribality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RH-OrcaShaman-sized-01-740x360.png' style="float:left;width:30%;padding:10px"/>

### Swimmer
When you choose this path, you gain 2 skill points to spend on Swimming.

### Totem Spirit
Choose a totem spirit. You must make or acquire a physical totem object - an amulet or similar adornment - that incorporates the teeth, skin or bones of the animal. At your option, you may also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, you may have dark eyes, a vicious smile, lack of hair or sharpened teeth.

You gain 1 skill point to spend on Animal handling. Additionally you have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with normal animals related to your totem spirit.


### Creature of the Sea
You gain the ability to cast the *water breathing* and *speak with animals* spells, but only as rituals, and only targeting yourself.

### Totemic Blessing
You gain a greater connection to your totem spirit. You gain a power based on your chosen animal. The power is only active while raging and not wearing heavy armor.

<div class="columns">

-   **Albatross.** The spirit of the albatross makes you into a opportunist who can weave through the fray with ease. Creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a **bonus action** on your turn.

-   **Crab.** The spirit of the lobster grants you its incredible resilience. Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage done to you is reduced by 3.

-   **Orca.** Orca travel and hunt in packs, learning to work together to defeat their prey. Your allies have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creatures adjacent to you.

-   **Shark.** The spirit of the shark makes you ferocious at the smell of blood. The spirit of the shark makes you ferocious at the smell of blood. You gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier whenever you damage a creature with a melee attack.

-   **Whale.** The spirit of the whale protects you from the elements. When you start your rage, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution score, which last until your rage ends. While you have those temporary hit points, you have resistance to cold and fire damage.

</div>


### Aspect of the Beast
You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

<div class="columns">

-   **Albatross.** This spirit helps you roam far and fast. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated (see chapter 8 in the Player's Handbook for more information about travel pace).

-   **Crab.** You suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.

-   **Orca.** While raging, you gain blindsight to a range of 10 feet in air, or 60 feet underwater. As this ability is gained by echolocation, you can't use this ability while deafened.

-   **Shark.** You gain the swiftness and senses of a shark. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and advantage on tracking creatures that do not have all their hit points.

-   **Whale.** As Orca.

</div>

### Oceanic Blessing
You may cast the *water breathing* spell granted by Creature of the sea on other targets than yourself.

Additionally you can cast the *commune with the sea* spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of your totem animal appears to you to convey the information you seek.



### Totemic Attunement
You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one, however, at least two of the selections must be from your totem animal.

<div class="columns">

- **Albatross.** While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your base walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

- **Crab.** While raging, any creature grappled by you takes 1d6 + your Strength modifier + your rage bonus in bludgeoning damage when it starts its turn.

- **Orca.** You learn to use your size and speed to your advantage in combat. While you are raging, you can use a ***bonus action*** on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with a melee attack.

- **Shark.** Your emotionless ferocity is more terrifying than any wild rage. While raging, enemies you damage with a melee weapon attack have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you, or if it can't be frightened.

- **Whale.** While raging, you are under the enlarge effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell. You also count as one size larger than your enraged size for the purposes of determining which creatures you can grapple and shove.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-berserker">Path of the Berserker</a></h1>

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features

| 1st | Intimidating Presence |
| 3rd | Frenzy |
| 6th | Mindless Rage |
| 10th | Terrifying Rampage |
| 14th | Retaliation |

</div>

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Intimidating Presence
When you choose this path at 1st level, you gain the *Physique - Intimidate* skill. If you have that skill already, you may spend a skill point on any other class skill.

### Frenzy
When raging, you can go into a frenzy. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a **bonus action** on each of your turns after this one.

When your frenzied rage ends, you lose one unspent hit die. If you don't have any hit die remaining, you instead suffer one level of exhaustion.

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/564x/79/f6/01/79f601f45459eacba48b6e42e460221c.jpg' style="float:right;width:30%;padding:10px"/>

### Mindless Rage
You can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Terrifying Rampage
You can frighten your enemies with your menacing presence. As an **action**, choose one creature within 30 feet that can see and hear you. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

On subsequent turns, you can use your **bonus action** to extend the duration of this effect until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
When you take damage from a creature, you can use your **reaction** to make a melee weapon attack against that creature




<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-courageousHeart">Path of the Courageous Heart</a></h1>

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features

| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Lucky, Matter at Hand |
| 3rd | Favor the Bold,  |
| 6th | Combat Focus |
| 10th | Stroke of Inspiration |
| 14th | Heroic Tenacity |

</div>

For some adventurers, their internal reservoir of fearlessness and gallantry might border closer to foolhardiness. An intrepid do-gooder might take the first step down this path by complete accident, meddling in affairs they ought not and finding themselves unable to turn back. Their impromptu effectiveness in battle isn’t due to anger but rather matching pluck, tenacity, or stubbornness to shrug off the worst the enemy has to offer. These brawlers might not be as graceful as trained fighters, but they're guardians of the weak, and what they lack in polish they make up for in valor.

### Matter at Hand
When you choose this path at 1st level, you gain the Brawler and Thrown weapon - Improvised Throwing combat skills.

Additionally, you can use any item, as long as you can pick it up, as a thrown weapon, dealing d6 damage if one-handed, or d10 if two-handed. Attacks with these items benefit from your bonus Rage damage and can be used with your Reckless Attack and Brutal Critical features.

### Lucky
Luck seems to be with you. When you roll a 1 on an check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

In addition you gain +2 to your Luck score.

### Favor the Bold
When the adrenaline kicks in, primal instinct propels certain heroes to awe-inspiring feats, seeming to add just a smidge of luck at the right moment. While raging, whenever you make a saving throw, or an attack roll with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total.

### Combat Focus
When you hit with an unarmed or improvised weapon attack while raging, roll 1d4 and add its total to the attack’s damage. In addition, when a hostile creature damages you while you are raging, reduce the damage by 1 (to a minimum of 0 damage).

This feature increases in potency as you gain barbarian levels to 2d4 damage/2 damage reduction at 10th, and 3d4 damage/3 damage reduction at 14th level.

### Stroke of Inspiration
You seem to stumble upon the right clue, connection, or words, even when you have no idea what is going on. When you fail a Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom-based ability check, you can spend 2 **Fury** to reroll the check with advantage.

### Tenacious Heart
Whenever you succeed at a Constitution saving throw to remain conscious with your Relentless Rage feature, you can use one of the following Tenacious Heart options of your choice. You can use each Tenacious Heart option only once per round.

**Inspiring.** You inspiring last stand fills your allies with renewed vigor. Allies within 30 ft that can see or hear you gain 10 temporary hit points.

**Persistent.** You won’t quit without a fight. The DC of your next Relentless Rage check is reduced by 5 until the end of your turn.

**Rallying.** Your heroic refusal to die fills your allies with confidence. Allies you that can see you gain advantage on the next attack roll they make within the next 1 minute.




<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-defender">Path of the Defender</a></h1>

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features

| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Chosen Charge, Alert |
| 3rd | Avert and Avenge |
| 6th | Dexterous Cover |
| 10th | Shared Alertness |
| 14th | Passive Aggressiveness |

</div>

Barbarians that follow the Path of the Defender have assumed the responsibility of keeping a bondmate alive. They are often charged with the safekeeping of people of importance, like a traveling priest, a tribe's shaman or elder, and so on, but just as often they simply form a bond with someone they either care for or share a common goal with, like a sibling or fellow adventurer.

### Chosen Charge
Starting when you choose this path at 1st level, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bond with one creature of your choosing. This bond is suppressed if one of you is charmed, but otherwise lasts until your bondmate dies or you perform this ritual again.

In order to reap the benefits from the bond, you must be within a certain range of your bondmate. This range is referred to as soul range, and for the Defender, who must almost be like a shadow to its bondmate, the range is 10 feet.

### Alert
You are always alert for dangers that might threaten your bondmate. Gain 1 skill point to spend on ***Perception***.

### Avert and Avenge
You have mastered guarding your bondmate from bodily harm. While raging and within soul range, if a creature you can see hits your bondmate with an attack, you can use a **reaction** to throw yourself in harm's way, forcing the damage to be dealt to yourself instead.

If you do, you switch places with your bondmate. When you take damage this way you have resistance to the damage and the first attack you make on your next turn has advantage and deals 1d6 additional damage if you hit.

You can't use this feature if either your movement speed or your bondmate's movement speed is 0 or you are otherwise hindered, for example by a wall or being chained.

### Dexterous Cover
Your reflexes allow you to shield your bondmate in even more ways. While within soul range, if a spell or effect would grant both you and the bondmate a Dexterity saving throw to avoid damage, you can, as a **reaction**, grant your bondmate advantage on its roll and resistance to the damage.

If your bond mate takes damage from this, the first attack you make on your next turn against the creature that caused the save (if any) has advantage and deals 1d6 additional damage if you hit.

### Shared Alertness
Instincts flow through the bond. While within soul range, both you and your bondmate are treated as if having the same Perception skills as the other, and neither of you can be surprised unless you both are.

### Passive Aggressiveness
You and your bondmate function even more like a team when faced with foes. While raging, if a hostile creature deals damage to you with an attack aimed at your bondmate, your bondmate can use a ***reaction*** to make an weapon or cantrip attack against it.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-hurler">Path of the Hurler</a></h1>

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features

| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Hurler's Aim |
| 3rd | Tossing Shove |
| 6th | Hurl Creature |
| 10th | Increasing Might |
| 14th | Wield Creature |

</div>

You began with throwing sticks, then stones. Eventually the sticks and stones changed, becoming darts, shotput, or other sports. But you were destined for more. Heavier and heavier stones, larger and larger sticks - boulders and cabers, ever increasing in heft. Anything you can lift, you can throw. And anything you can throw, you can triumph with.

Great skill is required to lob hefty weapons accurately, but there are some who prefer brutish strength over nimbleness and agility. The Path of the Hurler is one that few barbarians tread, but those who aim their sights on their quarry can learn to exert their rage from afar.

Many barbarian hunters choose to follow this path, eschewing the complexity of aiming a bow for the simplistic and primal joy of seeing a thrown axe or hammer smash the skull of their quarry. Other young barbarians who walk this path employ their skills in tavern games as often as true combat, impaling walls through knife targets and splintering dart boards with their great strength.


### Hurler's Aim
When you choose this path at 1st level, you gain 1 skill point to spend on Thrown weapon combat skills.

Additionally, you can use any item, as long as you can pick it up, as a thrown weapon, dealing d6 damage if one-handed, or d10 if two-handed. Attacks with these items benefit from your bonus Rage damage and can be used with your Reckless Attack and Brutal Critical features.

### Tossing Shove
Your skill with lifting and tossing objects extends to throwing allies and sending enemies flying. To do so, you must be raging and the affected creature must be your size or smaller.

You can throw willing creatures a distance equal to five times your Strength modifier. The thrown creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone when they land.

Once per turn you can double the distance you shove a creature. You can also turn the creature and shove it in any horizontal direction that isn't directly behind you

### Hurl Creature
You now truly master throwing other creatures. While raging and grappling a creature your size or smaller, you can use an ***action*** to throw them at a targeted location or creature. When thrown, the creature has a range of 10/20. The effects of the throw depend on the size of the thrown creature.

When targeting a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. Your save DC is equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. A thrown creature falls prone after landing. All damage dealt is bludgeoning damage, and you add your Strength modifier and Rage damage bonus to each damage.

* **Tiny**. The thrown creature takes 2d10 damage. A targeted creature takes damage equal to  your Strength modifier on a failure (i.e 2xStr + rage bonus), and none on a success.
* **Small**. The thrown creature takes 1d10 damage. A targeted creature takes 1d10 damage, or half as much on a success.
* **Medium**. The thrown creature takes 1d12 damage. A targeted creature takes 1d12 damage, or half as much on a success.
* **Large**. The thrown creature takes 1d12 damage. A targeted creature, and all creatures within 5 feet of the target location or creature must also make a saving throw, taking 1d12 damage or half that on success. For larger creatures, the size of this impact area increases by 5 feet per size category above Large.

### Increasing Might
You may use Tossing Shove and Hurl Creature while not raging. You can shove a creature one size larger than you with Tossing Shove, but only directly forwards. You can also throw a creature one size larger than you with Hurl Creature, but the range is decreased by half.

### Wield Creature
Your enemies become just another weapon in your arsenal. While raging, you can grapple a creature your size or smaller and choose to wield them as a weapon. You can make only one attack per turn in this way, and cannot wield any other items. On a hit, roll damage both for the creature you struck as well as the creature being wielded as a weapon.

Creatures that are Tiny or smaller cannot be used for this feature. Small creatures deal 1d8 damage, while Medium creatures deal 1d12 damage but have to be wielded in two hands. Large creatures deal 2d8 damage with the Reach property. Creatures of larger sizes continue to deal damage as a large creature, but add +5 bonus damage for each size category above Large.

Juggernaut barbarians are siege engines in their own right, able to stand their ground and move their foes into positions of weakness. While raging, they make any battlefield their domain, shoving enemies over mountain sides and destroying any battle formation trying to stand in their way.

### Stance of the Mountain
You harness your fury to anchor your feet to the earth, shrugging off the blows of those who wish to topple you. Upon choosing this path at 1st level, you cannot be knocked prone while raging unless you become unconscious.

### Thunderous Blows
Your rage instills you with the strength to batter around your foes, making any battlefield your domain.

Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you push the target 5 feet away from you, and you can choose to immediately move 5 feet into the target’s previous position.

In addition, you can replace one of your attacks during your attack action with a shove.

### Unstoppable
You can choose to become unstoppable when you enter a rage. If you do so, for the duration of the rage your speed cannot be reduced, and you are immune to the frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions.

If you are paralyzed or stunned, you can still take your bonus action to enter your rage and suspend the effects for the duration of the rage. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Relentless Will
Your mind is armored as you are single-minded in the pursuit of your foes, making you immune to any magic that allows creatures to read your mind.

You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws while raging, and while raging, whenever you succeed on a Wisdom saving throw due to a creature casting a spell, that creature suffers Psychic damage equal to twice your rage damage bonus.

### Wrought Endurance
You are a pillar of endurance, blows seeming to not harm you.

When you take damage while raging, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total.

You may do this a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. See *Rest Additions* below.

Every group intending to go into battle needs a good leader. One who leads from the front, who has a plan, who knows the strengths of his allies and deploys them where they will be the most effective. What they need is a barbarian of the Path of the Marauder.

Barbarians on this course find their rage brings great clarity of mind, allowing them to see all the ways the battle can be won. Through sly tactics and synergy, they make sure every member of their company is utilized to the fullest. These barbarians often aspire to a position where their gifts will be the most useful. You can choose this ambition or determine it by rolling on the Marauder's Ambition table.

### Marauder's Ambition

| d4 | Ambition |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1 | You dream at night of the high seas and the open sky, and know you could be a privateer captain without equal.
| 2 | One of your relatives leads an infamous company of bandits, and you aim to replace them.
| 3 | You don't care for fame, but the stakes and secrecy of being part of an elite military unit are all you've ever wanted.
| 4 | Hunting terrible monsters and otherworldly foes beside your friends seems like the ideal way to go out.


### Coarse Negotiator
You've learned a thing or two about how to make people see things from your perspective. You gain 2 skill points to spend on Leadership and 1 to spend on Speechcraft.

In addition, whenever you make a Leadership check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Strength modifier.

### Fighting Dirty
Tricks and teamwork ensure your victory. You can use this feature in the following two ways while raging:

* **Smokescreen**. You menace your foes, throwing them off from the real threat. As a ***bonus action***, you can distract an adjacent enemy that can see or hear you until the start of your next turn. Your allies have advantage on attack rolls against the distracted target.

* **Backscratch**. Your allies come to your aid, knowing you'll do the same for them. When you take damage from a creature you can see, you can use your ***reaction*** to choose one ally within 30 ft. That ally can make one weapon attack against the creature that damaged you, provided the target is within range of one of their weapon attacks.

You can use this feature once and regain its use when you finish a short rest. In addition  you can spend 2 **fury** as a ***bonus action*** to reset its use.

### Assured Assignment
You never have any trouble trusting your faithful crew to get things done. While you are raging, your allies gain a bonus to damage rolls against creatures adjacent to you. The bonus equals your rage damage bonus.

In addition, as part of the action you take to enter your rage, you may choose a number of allied creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 ft. Those creatures may immediately move up to half their speed.

### Improvised Assault
Knowing a good opportunity is the secret to a glorious career. When you take the Dash action while raging, you can choose to conduct an improvised assault, allowing you to make a number of melee weapon attacks equal to your proficiency bonus as part of this action, with each of these attacks must target a different creature.

You can use this feature once and regain its use when you finish a short rest.

### Leading by Example
As the foremost expert in the field of surprise surgery, your allies look to your demonstrations. Whenever you score a critical hit while raging, you can choose one ally within 30 ft. That ally may use their reaction to move up to half their speed and make one melee weapon attack. This ability cannot trigger off the same enemy more than once per round.

| 10th | Elemental Focus |
| 14th | Warden's Aura |

</div>

Barbarians in this path follow an ancient tradition rooted in powerful druidic magic. When these barbarians rage, they transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic; becoming one with the land, feeling the fury of the strip-mined earth and the desolated forest. The primal magic that inspires them to rage allows them to become one with nature, overcoming their foes with the indomitable strength of the primeval world.

These barbarians are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. They dwell in the most remote places of the world; the rare misty mountains and elder forests untouched by exploration. They venture out only rarely, as most of them consider it their sacred duty to protect the places that have stood unchanged since the world's earliest days.


### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. Gain it as if you had spent 2 skill points on the Language skill.

In addition you gain 2 skill points to spend on Nature.

### Form of the Warden
Your rage draws primal power through your spiritual link to the land, allowing you to become an aspect of nature.

When you enter your rage, you assume the form of a primeval guardian, taking on an appearance based on the lands and environment around you. Choose an appropriate form from below. You remain in this form until your rage ends.

If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Flame
    Your skin takes on the appearance of cracks with magma.

    When you enter this form, all creatures within 10 ft are dealt 2 fire damage. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

    When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 fire damage as a **bonus action**.

    When you enter this form, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

    Reduce all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take by 1d4.

    This form makes you slow and heavy. Your walking speed is reduced by 20 feet. Additionally, if you normally have a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, you can't use it while in this form.

    At the **end of your turn** you can choose to become unmovable. Until the beginning of your next turn, you cannot move or be moved.

- #### Storm
    You surround yourself with the elemental wind from the plains and mountains, allowing you to buffet your foes as you strike.

    When you enter this form, you can choose one other creature 10 ft. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

    Once per round when you hit an enemy with a melee weapon attack, that creature must succeed at a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet in any direction. If the save is failed by 10 or more, the target is also knocked prone.

    Additionally, ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage against you.


- #### Water
    Your body takes on the fluidity of elemental water.

    When you enter this form, you heal 1d6 hit points. The healing increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

    You gain resistance to fire.

    You can use your **reaction** to move without provoking opportunity attacks.

- #### Wood
    Your skin turns bark-like and becomes covered in ivy and moss.

    Your AC increases by 2.

    When you make a melee weapon attack, your reach is 5 feet greater than normal.

</div>

### Ancient Fortitude
Your rage imbues you with primeval life force.

If you start your turn raging you gain temporary hit points equal to half your barbarian level. You lose all temporary hit points you gain from this feature when your rage ends.

### Elemental Attunement
You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces nearby, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.
- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1- foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.


### Elemental Focus
If you start your turn raging, you can choose to switch your current Form of the Warden to a different form.

### Warden's Aura
Your guardian form emanates a magical aura that fortifies your allies. When you gain temporary hit points with the Ancient Fortitude feature, you can use a **bonus action** to grants each friendly creature within 20 feet of you the same amount of temporary hit points.

</div>

Though most tribes of the world may lack parchment to draw and write on, all have bodies. Barbarians of this primal path use their own bodies as a canvas, displaying their artistic talent and connection with their tattoos to the world. While most tattoos they create have a powerful connection to the natural world, many barbarians also choose to create tattoos without this connection, simply for display.

### Bonus Skills
When you choose this primal path at 1st level, you gain the Art - Drawing, Art - Tattooing skills and 1 additional skill point to spend on your class skills.

### Primal Tattoos
You can invoke tattoos on you body with your savage anger. You have a number of tattoos equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), chosen from the options at the end of this class description. When you enter a rage, you can activate the effects of tattoos you have on your body, to a maximum amount of tattoos activated at once equal to your rage damage bonus. You choose which tattoos you wish to activate every time you enter a rage.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace the magic of one tattoo on your body with a new one of your choice.

### Learned Artist
Your deep knowledge of tattoos and the arts also let you understand other things more. You gain 2 additional skill points to spend on Knowledge skills.

### Unclean Immunity
Your constant application of ink needles to your flesh has rendered you immune to the negative effects caused by unclean needles. You are immune to disease, gain resistance to poison damage, and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

### Masterwork Tattoos
Your tattoos are strong enough that they protect you from the outside world. As a reaction to you failing a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw while raging, you can choose to gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your rage damage bonus.

### Tattoos
You only gain the benefits of a tattoo for the duration of your rage. If a tattoo mimics the effects of a spell, the effect cannot be dispelled.

<div class="columns">

- **Bat**. You can glide on the wind like a graceful bat and are under the effects of the *feather fall* spell for the duration of your rage.
- **Bull**. You take on the powerful shoving capabilities of the bull. You can replace one of your attacks during your attack action with a shove and instead of forcing them back 5 ft, you force them back 10 ft.
- **Monkey**. Your grip is as tight as that of a monkey and can use the larger die of a versatile weapon while wielding it in one hand.
- **Panther**. Your leaps are as powerful of a pouncing panther. You add half your barbarian level to the distance of your long jumps, and your rage damage bonus to the height of your high jumps.
- **Lion**. Your bravery matches that of a lion and cannot be frightened for the duration of your rage. If you are frightened when entering rage, it only suppresses the effects until the end of your rage.

- **Turtle**. You are as defensive as a turtle. If not wielding a shield, your armor class increases by 2.

| 3rd | Grim Prophecy,<br>Lamb to the Slaughter |
| 6th | Cruel Fate |
| 10th | Rise and Fall |
| 14th | Blood for Blood |

</div>

Everyone dies, but your death was written in the stars themselves, ordained within the blood and entrails of a dying beast, and whispered of by the falling bones and shuffling cards of the diviners. You are going to die, and your death is going to mean something. The rise of a great evil, or the end of an era. The destruction of all you hold dear, or the redemption of your blackened soul. The arrival of the legions of light, or the end of fear itself.

In the end, you’ll be dead – sacrificed as an offering to fate and slain by a prophecy that cannot be changed by wishes alone. You embrace your fury in defiance of that prophecy, or to ensure that it arrives as was written. You scream with rage because your life means more than just an ending. When the time comes, you will be waiting, bloodstained weapon in hand.

### Not My Time
At 1st level, you discover or accept that your death is fated. If it is not your time to die yet, fate will be on your side. When you roll a 1 on a death saving throw, treat it as a 20.

### Grim Prophecy
The knowledge of your fate gives you a certain insight. You can cast *augury* at will as an ***action*** without using a material component, relying on your prophetic destiny to guide you. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can’t cast this spell in this way more than once per minute.


### Lamb to the Slaughter
Your fate affords those that surround you a measure of protection. Once per turn when you take damage while raging, you can choose to grant a friendly creature that you can see within 30 ft of you other than yourself temporary hit points equal to half the damage you took. These temporary hit points last for one minute.

### Cruel Fate
Your death draws ever closer, but your skill grows in turn. If the *augury* spell would give you a random result, the result is Woe. Each time you cast *augury*, are critically hit with an attack or fail a death saving throw, you gain a Defiance die, which is a d6. You can have up to two Defiance dice at a time. Once per turn when you take damage from an attack, you can expend and roll one of your Defiance dice, adding the roll to the damage result. When you do, you also add the same result to your next attack roll and damage roll.

### Rise and Fall
Your destiny overpowers the lesser lives of others. When you have 0 hit points and an ally within 30 ft of you is dealt damage, you can choose to expend and roll your defiance die to increase the damage by the result, and recover an equal amount of hit points.

### Blood for Blood
Your destined death awaits your arrival, and you refuse to surrender before the end of your journey. The first time each round that you lose hit points while raging, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the amount of hit points lost. These temporary hit points last until the start of your next turn. Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points while you are raging, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a single melee weapon attack against a target within reach. If this attack hits, it is a critical hit.

</div>

All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

<img src='https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/90586/assets/801523/thunder_barbarian.jpg?1511266560' style="float:left;width:25%;padding:10px"/>

### Thunder Sense
When you choose this path at 1st level, you can use your action to predict the weather for the next 24 hours. You can sense where within a 5 mile radius a storm will happen, what kind of storm it will be, and how intense the storm will be.

### Storm Aura
You emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 ft in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a ***bonus action***. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

- **Desert**. When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

- **Sea**. When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach  certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

- **Tundra**. When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

### Storm Soul
The storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

- **Desert**. You gain resistance to fire damage and don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an ***action***, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

- **Sea**. You gain resistance to lightning damage and can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 ft.

- **Tundra**. You gain resistance to cold damage and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an ***action***, you can touch water and turn a 5 ft cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube

### Shield of the Storm
You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.


### Raging Storm
The power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

- **Desert**. Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.

- **Sea**. When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

- **Tundra**. Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

#### Archetype Features

| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Totem Spirit |
| 3rd | Totemic Blessing |
| 6th | Aspect of the Beast |
| 10th | Spirit Walker |
| 14th | Totemic Attunement |

</div>

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage. Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

### Totem Spirit
At 1st level when you adopt this path, you choose a totem animal. You must make or acquire a physical totem object - an amulet or similar adornment - that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the animal. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

You gain 1 skill point to spend on Animal handling. Additionally you have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with normal animals related to your totem spirit.

### Spirit Seeker
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. You gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* and *speak with animals* spells, but only as rituals.

### Totemic Blessing
You gain a greater connection to your totem spirit, granting you a power based on your chosen animal.

### Aspect of the Beast
You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

### Spirit Walker
You can cast the *commune with nature* spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of your totem animal appears to you to convey the information you seek.

### Totemic Attunement
You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one, however, at least two of the selections must be from your totem animal.

- ### Tortoise

    **Aspect of the Beast.** You suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.

Your AC when not wearing armor also becomes 18, unless it is already higher. You can still use a shield and gain this benefit.

- ### Vulture
    The vulture is a majestic beast with strong beak and large wings that feed on the dead and the weak. These traits, together with its amazing sense of smell, make it a natural idol of worship for many tribes who admire its capabilities.

While some barbarians prefer a life of savage solitude, others long for a tribe. Barbarians on the Path of the War Chief are leaders and warrior kings who can turn any scrappy group of companions into a tight-knit tribe. Inspiring their allies to victory with battle cries and war songs, war chiefs lead every battle from the frontline.

### Bonus Skills
When you adopt this path at 1st level, you gain 1 skill point each in History, Language and Speechcraft.

### Tribal Leader
You learn to bolster the resolve of your allies, and crush that of your enemies, with battle cries. You learn two battle cries of your choice, which are detailed under “Battle Cries” below. You learn an additional battle cry of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Each time you learn a new battle cry, you can also replace one battle cry you know with a different one.

You can issue one of your battle cries as an ***action*** on your turn. When you do, you choose a creature other than yourself within 30 ft of you that can hear you as the target for the battle cry. That target gains the effect of the chosen battle cry.

While raging, you can issue a battle cry as a ***bonus action*** on your turn.

### War Song
You augment your rage with a tribal song or chant that inspires greater power in your allies’ attacks. While raging, when a friendly creature other than yourself within 15 ft of you hits with an attack, the attack gains a bonus to its damage equal to half your rage damage bonus. A creature must be able to hear you to gain the benefits of this feature.


### Commanding Presence
You gain a supernatural ability to influence and inspire obedience in others. You can cast the *command* and *suggestion* spells once each without using a spell slot or material components. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells.

See *Rest Additions*.

### Chieftain’s Voice
Your voice booms with such incredible authority that even those who cannot hear it are compelled to listen. If a creature is deafened, it still counts as hearing you when you speak for the purpose of your War Chief features.

Additionally, the range of your War Song increases to 30 ft, and when you issue a battle cry, you can choose a creature within 60 ft as the target for its effects.

## Battle Cries

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Bolstering Yip**. Until the start of your next turn, the target has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

- **Cautionary Bellow**. The target has advantage on the first Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

- **Challenging Call**. The target can use its movement only to move closer to you during its next turn. The creature can choose not to move. This battle cry has no effect on a creature immune to being charmed.

- **Defensive Holler**. The first attack made against the target before the start of your next turn is made with disadvantage.

- **Empowering Howl**. The first time the target hits with a weapon attack before the start of your next turn, it gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to your Charisma modifier.

- **Hastening Whoop**. The target can use its ***reaction*** to move up to half its speed. If this movement provokes an opportunity attack, the attack roll is made with disadvantage.

- **Infuriating Bark**. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn. This battle cry has no effect on a creature immune to being charmed.

- **Inspiring Roar**. The first time the target makes an attack roll or ability check before the start of your next turn, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or ability check.

- **Invigorating Shout**. The target gains temporary hit points equal 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. It loses any of these remaining temporary hit points at the start of your next turn.

- **Maddening Ululation**. The target has advantage on the first melee weapon attack it makes before the start of your next turn, and the first attack made against it before then by a creature other than you is made with advantage. This battle cry has no effect on a creature immune to being charmed.

- **Terrifying Shriek**. The target can’t willingly move closer to you during its next turn. This battle cry has no effect on a creature immune to being frightened.

</div>

</div>

Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots—warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

### Warrior of the Gods
Starting when you choose this path at 1st level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as *raise dead*, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.

### Divine Fury
You can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes 1d6 extra damage. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

### Fanatical Focus
The divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

### Zealous Presence
You learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a ***bonus action***, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 ft of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature once. See *Rest Additions*.

### Rage beyond Death
The divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-tailfighter">Restricted to characters with a tail</a></h2>
<h1>Path of the Tailfighter</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Path Features
| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Tail Adept |
| 3rd | Tail Fighter |
| 6th | Lashing Defense, Tail Fighter (d4) |
| 10th | Quick Stand, Tail Fighter (d6) |
| 14th | Tripping Tail, Tail Fighter (d8) |

</div>

Originally developed by the savage ratfolk warriors, the frenzied, spinning method of tailfighting can only loosely be described as a martial style. By using their tails as both defensive aids and lethal weapons, the tailfighter can catch even the most seasoned opponent off guard.

##### Racial Restriction
Only races the physiology to support it can follow the Path of the Tailfighter, i.e. races with tails. This includes Lizardfolk, Ratfolk and some Tieflings.

### Tail Adept
You develop considerable coordination with your tail, allowing you to manipulate or hold simple items such as a lantern or a pitcher with it. You cannot make fine movements or manipulate tiny objects with it, such as picking pockets, using thieves’ tools, or turning a key in a lock.

### Tail Fighter
You can use your tail to make unarmed strikes, dealing 1 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. At 6th level this damage increases to 1d4. At 10th level it increases to 1d6, and at 14th level to 1d8. If you are holding an item in your tail, you cannot make a tail attack.

In addition to normal attacks, you can attack with your tail using a ***bonus action*** as if it were an off-hand weapon, even while wielding a two-handed weapon.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

### Tail Weapons
Some tailed races have created weapons that can be used on their tails. Usually it’s only something sharp or heavy strapped at the end of the tail, which cuts or smashes when swung. These weapons can be used similar to offhand weapons, while allowing for one free hand.

It takes a minute to properly strap a tail weapon for use, but nothing prevents it from being strapped for the entire day. However, this prevents a tail to manipulate objects if it otherwise does. Removing a strapped weapon takes half the time.


| Name | Price  | Weight | Special |
|:-----|:-----:|:------:|:-----------|
| Tailblade | 10 gp | 1 lbs | Increases damage by +1. Tail attack deals slashing damage instead.
| Tail Mace | 10 gp | 8 lbs | Increases damage to the next die size.
</div>

### Lashing Defense
You have learned to use your lashing tail and your wild, spinning combat style to protect yourself. While raging, when an opponent makes a melee attack against you, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the opponent’s attack misses, you may make a tail attack against one target within reach as part of the same reaction.

### Quick Stand
Your tail is so much a part of your movement that it acts much like an extra leg and can even prop you up when you’ve fallen. You have advantage on saving throws against any effect that would knock you prone or force you to move by pushing or pulling. Standing from prone costs you only 5 feet of movement.

### Tripping Tail
You can use your tail to make opportunity attacks. If you hit and the target is Large or smaller, in addition to damage, it must make a Strength saving throw against 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). On a failed save, you knock the target prone and its movement is reduced to 0.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-skinchanger">Restricted to characters who can change shape naturally</a></h2>
<h1>Path of the Skinchanger</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

| 1st | Wild Rage |
| 3rd | Skinchanger |
| 6th | Ten Thousand Masks |
| 10th | Primal Rage |
| 14th | Ten Million Masks |

</div>

You belong to a tradition of barbarians who uses their shapechanging heritage to partially adopt the shape of beasts while raging, looking for all the world like a lycanthrope though they do not suffer such a curse. As these barbarians grow in power their ability to change their forms improves.

##### Restriction
This path is only accessible to creatures who can change shape naturally, such as shifters, changelings and lycanthropes.

### Wild Rage
When you enter a rage you add the benefit of an animal to the benefits of your rage. A shifter, lycanthrope or other creature with only one animal form, can only use the benefits of the animal which their heritage is based on. While raging, they are also shifted, but without spending a use. A changeling or creature who can assume multiple forms, can choose any of the listed animal forms. After using a form, you cannot choose another until after you finish a long rest.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Bat.** As a ***bonus action*** you can shriek or catch the wind. If you shriek, you have blindsight up to 60 ft away until the end of your next turn. If you catch the wind, you fly 20 ft and take no damage from falling until the end of your next turn.

- **Boar.** When you move 15 ft or more directly towards a creature on your turn, you can spend your ***bonus action*** to gore them with your tusks. You have proficiency with this attack and add your Strength modifier to hit and damage. The gore attack deals 1d4 slashing damage and the target must succeed at a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + the damage you dealt with this attack.

- **Rat.** You gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against disease, poison and restrained effects. In addition, you can carry and use a light weapon with your tail as if it were carried off-hand.

- **Shark.** You gain a swim speed of 30 ft and can breathe underwater. As a ***bonus action*** you can bite a creature that has less than their maximum hit points. You have proficiency with the bite attack and add your strength modifier to hit and damage. The base damage of the bite attack is 1d4 piercing damage.

- **Wolf.** As a ***reaction*** you can hound a creature when it moves out of your reach. When you hound a creature you move half your movement speed and must move as close to the creature triggering the reaction as possible. Then you can make a melee attack as a part of the same reaction.

</div>

### Skinchanger
You gain the ability to turn into an animal exactly as described in the druid's Wild Shape feature, but can only use the feature once before needing a long rest to use again. This Wild Shape feature improves at 4th and 8th level, just as it does for druid.

### Ten Thousand Masks
Your ability to change your own form improves and you can cast the *enhance ability* spell (targeting yourself only). After casting the spell with this feature you must complete a long rest to use this ability again.

In addition, as part of the ***bonus action*** you use to enter a rage, you can cast *alter self* or *enlarge* (targeting yourself only). Unlike the spell you do not need to concentrate to continue the effect but the effect ends when your rage does.

### Primal Rage
Your wild rage has even greater rewards. Add an additional benefit to the normal benefits of your rage.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Bat.** You have a fly speed of 30 ft.

- **Boar.** Once per turn when a creature makes an opportunity attack against you, you can make a gore attack against it after its opportunity attack is resolved.

- **Rat.** You are immune to poison and disease. As a ***bonus action*** you can spread dirt and filth across your weapon. The next time you damage a creature with that weapon they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or be poisoned until the end of their next turn.

- **Shark.** When you deal damage to a creature with less than half its hit points remaining you deal an additional 1d4 damage.

- **Wolf.** When you hound a creature you can move your full movement speed instead of half your movement speed.

</div>

### Ten Million Masks
You can cast the *enhance ability* spell (targeting yourself only) at will. In addition, you can now use the Wild Shape granted by your Skinchanger feature twice before needing a long rest.

They are believed to have been touched by the dwarven gods of battle, who taught them that if they die in battle, they will be reincarnated stronger than before as a just reward. Therefore, they have no fear of death. Most live short, glorious lives.

Battleragers command grudging, if fearful, respect within dwarven society, where they are known to have coined such philosophically complex dwarven maxims like “head first” and “if it moves, kill it.”

While enraged, a battlerager’s face becomes distorted and twisted. His teeth grind together as spittle flies from his mouth and dribbles down his beard. His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become bloodshot. Charging into battle, he bellows forth his clan or holy war song, throwing his hammers and axes all the way, before cleaving his foes with his mighty dwarven waraxe. In short, he becomes almost unstoppable. Battleragers are often covered from head to toe in body art, from tattoos to brands to ritual scars. They prefer to wear bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself.

The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarf society and culture. He is a fearless and impulsive warrior, able to enter into an insane rampage. Battleragers are ruthlessly used by dwarf generals for their shock power against attacking armies. While heroic battle is honored in dwarven society and battleragers often excel in this, more often than not they also epitomize lives wasted in stupid rage, something most dwarves realize they cannot afford in a world filled with orcs and goblins.

##### Restriction
Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

<h1>Path of the Quake Bringer</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Path Features
| Class Level | Feature |
| :-: | :--- |
| 1st | Earthen
| 3rd | Stone Rage
| 6th | Demolisher
| 10th | Cliff Running
| 14th | Seismic Smash

</div>

To match the grand fury and power of an earthquake or avalanche, barbarians of the Path of the Quake Bringer channel primal power, drawing on the element of earth when they rage to turn their body to stone. These warriors test their strength by smashing boulders and leaping chasms. In battle, they embody the earthquake itself, leaving craters, rubble, and terror in their rumbling wake.

Quake bringers often come from cultures connected to the earth (especially if they value strength) such as those of dwarves, goliath, or firbolgs. Earth genasi can manifest these abilities using latent elemental power. Some quake bringers communed with earth spirits or spent years in isolation on a mountain to gain power.

##### Restriction
Only dwarves ans earth genasi can follow the Path of the Quake Bringer.

### Earthen
You cannot be petrified, and when you are pushed or pulled, you can reduce the distance you are moved by up to 5 ft.

### Stone Rage
Your rage armors you with rumbling stone. You gain the following benefits while raging.
- At the start of each of your turns and when you start raging, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 + half your barbarian level. They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.
- You can use a ***bonus action*** to shake the ground within 5 ft of you. It becomes difficult terrain for other creatures until the start of your next turn.

### Demolisher
Your elemental power focuses into mighty blows that smash even stone. You deal double damage with melee weapon attacks to objects and structures. When you hit a target composed of earth (dirt, crystal stone, metal etc.) with a melee weapon attack, your weapon is treated as if it were magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance, and if the target is an object or structure, you also gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to half your barbarian level

Also, you have advantage on Strength checks made to dig, demolish, or excavate using a tool or object.


### Cliff Running
You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You don't need free hands to use this speed unless you are climbing a surface that isn't made of some kind of earth.

In addition, when you jump off of a surface made of earth, you draw power from the earth to boost your leap, increasing your high jump distance by a number of feet equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1) and your long jump distance by twice that amount.
Finally, you have tremorsense that extends out to a radius of 60 feet while you are raging, allowing you to sense through the earth.

### Seismic Smash
You gain the ability to smash the ground itself and create a great seismic shockwave. As an ***action*** while raging and wielding a melee weapon, you can strike the ground with this power. Each other creature on the ground within 30 ft must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). You can choose to use a smaller radius, if desired.

On a failed saving throw, a target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your barbarian level + your Strength modifier and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5 ft radius portion requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand. When you use this ability, you can choose to damage the ground in the area, structures in contact with the ground in the area, both, or neither. This ability deals twice as much damage to those objects.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

</div>

Although they are cold and calculating, the followers of this path combine ancient teachings and new knowledge to instill emotion and aggressiveness in themselves.

### Tracker
If you have the prerequisite (*Survival*), the *Tracking* skill has cost 0 for you.

### Spoils of the Hunt
You learn an ancient ritual that lets you tap into your primal side by drawing out memories from fallen creatures. To perform this ritual, you must spend 1 hour with the trophy of a creature that's been dead no more than 24 hours. The ritual counts as light activity. While wearing or carrying the trophy, you gain the following benefits that last until you perform this ritual again.

- While raging, you can add your Wisdom modifier to damage rolls against that creature's type.
- While raging, you can make a bite attack as a bonus action against that creature's type.
