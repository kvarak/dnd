# Monster Hunter

In a landscape tormented by all manner of beasts, devils, and abominations from beyond the veil, most live in fear of the dark, of superstition, and of the unknown. Some grow hardened by this experience, instead choosing to stand up and fight against the tide of shadow. These folk are called “heroes'.

Some, however, are so fanatical and bent on destroying the anethema that plagues the countryside that they embrace dark, forbidden knowledge. They sacrifice some of their own vital force in dubious, forgotten blood rituals to better understand their enemies. Their methods sometimes blur the line between themselves and the evils they hunt, calling their own humanity into question. These folk are the Monster Hunters.

### Become the Enemy to Understand the Enemy
These warriors have chosen to merge the martial pursuit of deadly weapon play with elements of vicious blood magic to create effective combat techniques. Their deep knowledge and unnatural connection with wicked creatures allows them an advantage in tracking, hunting, and destroying even the most resilient of abhorrent fiends. To achieve this, some monster hunters brew crude, poisonous alchemical tonics from the harvested organs of felled monsters, mutating their blood and bodies to be even further in tune with their quarry, becoming something other than human themselves.

Others go further, reaching out and making a pact with lesser dark entities in hopes of using their grim gifts against greater evils. Many monster hunters push too far for their goals, falling to their own hubris and becoming the monsters they've chosen to hunt. This is the greatest fear of a monster hunter, and of the societies at large that shun them.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

##### Designer note
The monster hunter is basically a specialized form of ranger, who sacrifices some of its divine magic and knowledge of the natural world in order to more efficiently hunt their chosen prey.

</div>


### Almost as Feared as Their Prey
The nature of their abilities and training has bred many rumors across the lands, some of which aren't too far from the truth. Common folk consider them cursed, often turning them away at the door. Nobles see them as occasionally convenient, but a generally reviled nuisance. Mages find them useful allies if kept at arm's length, while pious clerics and paladins keep their distance with a watchful eye. To be a monster hunter is to accept a life of solitude until proven trustworthy and dependable.

### The Importance of Allies
While a monster hunter begins their journey alone, they also acknowledge the strength in numbers and the benefits of trusted companions. Many monster hunters keep allies to both ensure that they succeed at their hunts, and to keep a watchful eye to prevent them from losing touch with their humanity. A monster hunter without conviction is lost, and often an honest friend is enough to keep them from straying.

### Monster Hunter Tradition
 *1st-level feature*

Monster hunters usually do not form any organizations, instead a monster hunter takes on one or several apprentices during their lifetime, learning them the craft and the traditions they themselves were taught.

Choose an tradition from the ones detailed at the end of the class description. When you join this tradition, you have survived the imbibing of the Hunter's Bane, a poisonous alchemical concoction that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it.

The tradition you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Crimson Rite
 *1st-level feature*

You have learnt how to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this choice.

As a ***bonus action***, you imbue a single weapon with the energy of a known rite until your next short rest. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage and are considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain monster hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite die column of the class table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete.

When a crimson rite is activated, you suffer damage equal to your character level, and reduce your maximum hit points an equal amount. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points.

Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time (no action required).

You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level, and may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.

#### Primal Rites
Choose from the following:
- **Rite of the Flame**. Your rite damage is fire.
- **Rite of the Frozen**. Your rite damage is cold.
- **Rite of the Storm**. Your rite damage is lightning.




#### Esoteric Rites
Choose from the following:
- **Rite of the Roar**. Your rite damage is thunder.
- **Rite of the Oracle**. Your rite damage is psychic.
- **Rite of the Dead**. Your rite damage is necrotic.

### Sworn Enemy
 *1st-level feature*

As a monster hunter, you hunt all creatures that you consider a threat. However, your tradition and the source of your hunter’s bane makes you an expert in destroying one particular type of enemy. This enemy is defined in your chosen tradition, and against that enemy the following applies:

- You have advantage on checks to track and investigate enemies of that type.
- You have advantage on checks to recall information about them.
- You know a language typically spoken by your sworn enemy or creatures associated with it. If your enemy does not have a language, you can select any other language.








### Blood Curse
 *2nd-level feature*

You gain the knowledge to further channel and sacrifice a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate your enemies. You learn a number of blood curses equal to your proficiency bonus. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace a curse you know. <a href="#internal-bloodCurses">The blood curse options are listed at the end of class description.</a>

When invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you may choose to amplify the curse by suffering damage equal to your Crimson rite die. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, as noted in its description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses (DM's discretion).

Unless otherwise noted, you can use each blood curse once per short rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your blood curse require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Curse Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Fighting Style
 *2nd-level feature*

You adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options from the <a href="fighter.html#internal-FightingStyles">fighter list of fighting styles</a>. You can’t take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Ability Score Increase
 *4th-level feature*

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
 *5th-level feature*

You can now attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.



### Brand of Castigation
 *7th-level feature*

When you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand into its mind (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and if it is one of your sworn enemies, then each time the branded creature deals damage to you, it suffers psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. It counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your class level (maximum of 9th level spell).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target is your sworn enemy you can use this feature without spending its use.

### Hardened Soul
 *9th-level feature*

You can no longer become frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical charm effects.

### Dark Augmentation
 *10th-level feature*

The arcane blood magic empowers your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while a Crimson Rite is active, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this ability once per long rest.

Additionally, when a creature lands a critical hit on you, you can spend your ***reaction*** to immediately make an attack against that creature with a weapon that bears your Crimson Rite.

### Brand of Tethering
 *13th-level feature*

The psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.

### Enduring Form
 *17th-level feature*

Your exposure to forbidden magics and the essence of death itself has halted your mortal clock. You no longer age naturally or magically, making you immortal to the ravages of time.


### Sanguine Mastery
 *20th-level feature*

Your Crimson rite is now perfected, no longer requiring visceral sacrifice. When you have an active Crimson rite, you no longer reduce your maximum hit points and you take no damage when amplifying blood curses.

Whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain use of your Blood Curse feature.

In addition, when you are below one fourth of your current maximum hit points and conscious, all of your Crimson rite damage dice are maximized.

</div>

Those following the Tradition of the Blue Blood are individuals of heritage and prestige. Whether by means of birth, grit or whispers, you are selected among the few who have the eyes and ears of influential members of society, be they crown, industry or underworld. These hunters are often the best choice for missions that require a delicate touch or the soul of discretion.




### Influence in the Veins
 *1st-level feature*

The bonds of influence run through your veins, sharpening your social skills. You have proficiency on Charisma checks made when communicating with the upper echelons of society, as well as other individuals in leading positions.

Furthermore, whenever you roll a Charisma ability check, you can roll a Crimson Rite Die; you lose health equal to the rolled result and add the rolled result to the total for that ability check. You can do this after roll, but before you know the results.

### Sworn enemy
 *1st-level feature*

Your greatest enemies hide amongst your allies and acquaintances. They are the nobles, guild and government leaders who are in league with dark forces, whether devil worshipers, doppelgangers or servants of a dark god.

### Blood Curse of Temptation
 *3rd-level feature*

You learn a secret Blood Curse, the Blood Curse of Temptation. This Blood Curse does not count against your number of total known Blood Curses. You can use this Blood Curse once without expending a use of your Blood Maledict feature. You regain the ability to do so upon completing a Short or Long Rest.

<div class="feat">

## Blood Curse of Temptation
As a **bonus action**, you can target one humanoid creature within 30 ft. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw or else they are unable to willingly move away from you or use their reaction as your presence plagues their mind.

**Amplify**. The target becomes Charmed by you for 10 minutes. This effect ends early if you or anyone the creature can recognize as your ally attacks them or otherwise subject them to harm. After the effect ends, the creature's memories are hazy and it must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC in order to deduce that it had been subject to a charm.

</div>

### Spoiled Scion
 *7th-level feature*

The shield of fortune extends beyond status and is woven directly into your blood. Whenever you use a class feature that would cause you to lose health equal to the roll of a Crimson Rite Die, you can reduce the amount of health you would lose to 1 if the die displays a result of 5 or greater.



### Silvertongue Sabotage
 *11th-level feature*

After many nights conspiring amid a smokey back room or opulent ball you have learned from the best gossips and godfathers how to undermine your foes with precise verbal snipes and snares. When a creature within 30 ft makes an ability check or saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to roll a Crimson Rite die; you lose health equal to the rolled result, and the result is subtracted from the total of that saving throw or ability check. A creature is immune to this effect if they cannot see or hear you.

### By Bloody Decree
 *15th-level feature*

The word and the bond of your blood is law. You learn the spell *command*. Wisdom is your casting stat for this spell. You can cast this spell as an action by rolling a Crimson Rite die and then losing health equal to the result of the roll.

### Debt of Blood
 *18th-level feature*

Your influence has grown to the point where you can demand and withdraw the blood of your branded foes. You can now use your Brand of Castigation feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (min 2).

If you would roll a Crimson Rite die and lose health equal to the rolled result, you can instead choose to focus your will upon your branded creature if it is within 60 ft, and subject them to the tax of blood, causing the creature to take Psychic damage equal to the result of the roll. You cannot use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

| 18th | Slayer of the Unknown

</div>

Blood hunters certainly don't lack versatility among them; from striking pacts with beings they'd otherwise hunt to downing hazardous mutagens made on a whim. However, those that follow the teachings of the Crimson Eye don't care much for theatrics and supernatural displays. They prefer to stick to the tradition of remaining obscure, all the while collecting information on their quarry and striking with lethal force.



### Sworn enemy
 *1st-level feature*

You hunt all types of monsters, but are specialized in a type. However, your specialization is not as narrow as in many other traditions. Choose one of the following creature types as your sworn enemy: aberration, celestial, construct, elemental, and monstrosity. You can select another creature type from this list at 7th level. and again at 11th level.

### Collector of Lost Lore
 *1st-level feature*

In the fight against monsters, information is a valuable tool. You are proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.

### Eldritch Hunter
 *3rd-level feature*

Choose one monster type that is your sworn enemy. Your weapon deals one additional Crimson Rite die damage while your Crimson Rite is activated. If you have multiple sworn enemies, you can change the monster type after each short rest.

### Probing Brand
 *7th-level feature*

Your heightened knowledge is enhanced by the ancient magic learned by your fellow hunters. When you activate your Brand of Castigation feature, you glimpse into the combat prowess of your target. You immediately learn the creature's damage immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

In addition, when you roll rite damage against a branded creature, when you roll a 1 or 2, you can reroll and take the new result.



### Adapting to Surpass
 *11th-level feature*

The traits of your quarries have become easier to circumvent. As a ***bonus action***, you make a Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated, contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, your Crimson Rite die increases to the next die size when rolling for rite damage against the targeted creature.

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.

### Blood Curse of Shared Secrets
 *15th-level feature*

Your blood curse can pass along carefully accumulated knowledge as though it was instinct. You gain the Blood Curse of Shared Secrets. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.

<div class="feat">

**Amplify**. The creature also adds your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier to their AC.

</div>

### Slayer of the Unknown
 *18th-level feature*

The worst of monsters become almost indistinguishable to you as their weaker counterparts. While a creature within 30 feet is affected by your Brand of Castigation feature, and you are not incapacitated, you have advantage on attack rolls made against it. In addition, damage dealt to you by the creature is halved.





<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-curseEater">Tradition of the Curse Eater</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Tradition Features
| Class level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bewitchment Seeker, Sworn enemy |
| 3rd | Curse Specialist
| 7th | Devour Curse
| 11th | Brand of the Refined Jinx
| 15th | Blood Curse of Shackled Revenge
| 18th | Crippling Hex

</div>

When desperate people fall prey to unfair deals of hags, the Curse Eater undoes the damage done. When dangerous items are sold to unsuspecting townsfolk, the Curse Eater removes them from the world. When bored fey creatures find their kicks in tormenting helpless mortals with bizarre afflictions, the Curse Eater returns the favor in kind. When lycanthropy runs rampant through a village’s populace, the Curse Eater is there to quell the beast inside those diseased.

Armed with wards embedded into the hunter’s body and through the studying of old documentation on reverse engineering curses, the tradition works quickly to extinguish catastrophic magical effects. With the defined purpose of sniffing out hexes, jinxes, and curses, the hunters of this tradition have won the hearts of those that have been liberated from these effects. They have also gained scorn from those who would use such vile tricks, especially when they find those tricks have little effect on the hunters.

Having the ability to resist such magic has given the Curse Eaters a secondary role. When a hunter has become like the beasts they swore to eliminate, disregarded their oaths to protect the innocent, or fallen to darker temptations, it's certain that a Curse Eater will make their way to dispatch the rogue member. When the common folk ask “Who hunts the huntsman?”, the Curse Eaters are there to answer those calls.




### Bewitchment Seeker
 *1st-level feature*

You innately know when a creature is under a charm, curse, or possession on close inspection. Additionally, you are immune to the adverse effects of any cursed item that you wield and you can end attunement from the curse item after a long rest.

### Sworn enemy
 *1st-level feature*

Your sworn enemies are the ones with powers to curse, including all fey.



### Curse Specialist
 *3rd-level feature*

Your tradition teaches advanced mastery over blood curses. You gain access to one additional Blood Curse. In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.

### Devour Curse
 *7th-level feature*

As an ***action***, you can touch a creature to have your wards consume the magical energies that are affecting the creature. The creature is no longer charmed, frightened, possessed, cursed as if under the effects of the remove curse spell, or the creature is granted advantage on the next spell saving throw to break free from an ongoing spell. If the creature is under an effect of a cursed item, that curse is suspended until your next long rest. When you use this ability you lose one unspent hit die. If you don't have any hit die remaining, you instead suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Brand of the Refined Jinx
 *11th-level feature*

Your Brand of Castigation now holds the marked creature at the mercy of your vast familiarity of curses. When you are within 10 ft of the branded creature, you can amplify your Blood Maledict against the branded creature without taking any extra damage when doing so.

### Blood Curse of Shackled Revenge
 *15th-level feature*

You’ve honed your craft to lash powerful magic between yourself and the source of that power. You gain the Blood Curse of Shackled Revenge. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.

<div class="feat">

## Curse of Shackled Revenge
As a ***reaction***, when you or an ally within 15 ft are targeted by a spell or other magical effect, you tether the effect of the spell to you and the source creature as the new targets of the effect. All saving throws are changed to an Intelligence saving throw using your Blood Curse DC. If the effect requires concentration, you maintain the concentration and any additional effects are determined as if you are the source of the effect.

**Amplify**. The tethered spell or magical effect only targets the source creature allowing you to ignore the effects entirely.

</div>

### Crippling Hex
 *18th-level feature*

When you hit a creature with an attack that bears your Crimson Rite, you can use a ***bonus action*** to send a hex into the creature. The creature must succeed a wisdom saving throw or waste their action in a crippling contortion until the end of their next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-duskwarden">Tradition of the Duskwarden</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Tradition Features
| Class level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Low-light Vision, Sworn enemy
| 3rd | Rite of Dusk |
| 7th | Mist Glide
| 11th | Gifts of Dusk |
| 15th | Axis of Mortality |
| 18th | Blood of Light

</div>

Vampirism is an unnatural scourge that is not of this world. Unholy creatures terrorize the countryside with an unquenchable thirst for blood. The only ones who stand between these powerful creatures and the innocent are the Duskwardens.

The Tradition uses vampirism against vampires and the undead to protect the innocent. The Hunter’s Bane potion used to transform mortals into monster hunters is infused with the blood vampires, granting followers the benefits of vampirism such as slowed aging, heightened senses and speed, and greater potency for their blood rites and curses, without the bloodthirst that true vampires have.




### Low-light Vision
 *1st-level feature*

The Hunter’s Bane potion has granted you superior vision. You can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and an additional 60 feet into darkness as if it were dim light.

### Sworn enemy
 *1st-level feature*

Your sworn enemies are the vampires, and all types of creatures working with them, including human servitors, bats and wolves.

### Rite of Dusk
 *3rd-level feature*

You learn the esoteric rite Rite of Dusk. This rite damage is considered radiant against undead creatures, and necrotic against the living.

If you hit a vampire or other undead with your Rite of Dusk, it suffers additional radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. Upon reaching 11th level, all creatures suffer this additional damage of the appropriate type.

### Mist Glide
 *7th-level feature*

You can move as mist to reach your prey. As a ***bonus action*** move up to half your movement speed toward a creature you can see or sense.



You become intangible for this movement and can pass through creatures, objects, structures, and difficult terrain without expending extra movement, but can not end the movement inside a creature, object, or structure. If the target is at half its hit points or below, this movement equals your whole movement speed instead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Gifts of Dusk
 *11th-level feature*

Your vampirism combined with the Hunter’s Bane has gifted you with the unnatural abilities of your foes. Whenever you deal damage with the Rite of Dusk, you gain temporary hit points equal to your rite damage, not exceeding your hit point maximum. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all uses after a short rest.

In addition, your vampiric blood grants you 30 ft darkvision.

| 15th | Gravesight |
| 18th | Vengeful Spirit |

</div>

The Ghostslayer tradition is one of the oldest and most driven of the traditions, having rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath.

Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition. Some will sit with the terminally diseased to closely witness their passing, while others go so far as to deliberately have a near death experience, allowing them to tune their body and senses to the ethereal realms beyond.





### Stand Fast
 *1st-level feature*

As an action, you may touch a creature and end one effect causing the charmed or frightened condition. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all expended uses after a short rest.

### Sworn enemy

Your sworn enemies are ghosts, as well as other undead and monsters that move through the ethereal plane.

### Rite of Dawn
 *3rd-level feature*

You learn the esoteric rite Rite of Dawn. This rite damage is force. If you hit a creature both ethereal and undead, it suffers additional radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

### Hallowed Veins

In addition, you become spectral for the duration, allowing you to move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If this surge ends while you are inside an object, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.

### Gravesight
 *15th-level feature*

Your vision has been so tuned to the ethereal curtain between worlds, that even the unseeable cannot escape your view. You can see invisible or ethereal creatures and objects.

 *18th-level feature*

You can project your spirit to fight on while on the edge of death. Whenever your hit points drop to 0, you can choose to let your soul emerge from your body to fight on.

Your body remains unconscious and subject to death saving throws as normal. At the beginning of your next turn, you manifest a spirit form in your space that picks up your weapons and continues fighting under your control. Your spirit form has your physical attributes and AC, and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. This form is immune to cold, necrotic and non-magical weapon damage. Your spirit form has access to all of your abilities other than your blood curse feature, and suffers no damage from your Crimson Rite feature.

If your spirit form takes any damage, your body dies, or you regain hit points, your spirit form vanishes. If your spirit form vanishes, it drops your weapons in its space.

| 18th | Heartless Hunter |

</div>

The followers of this tradition mistrust even the most benevolent-seeming fey at the best of times. They are dogged hunters who believe fey have no regard for mortal life, and seek to teach them the meaning of mortality to correct their capricious behavior. Gloaming Hunters are often quite friendly toward humanoids, but once immortality enters the question they are often known to be biased against such creatures.

A Gloaming Hunter's bane is infused with the magic of the feywild and enchanted with iron dust, enhancing their ability to hunt creatures that are averse to the metal.





### Iron Rites
 *1st-level feature*

You learn the Rite of the Ferrous. Your rite damage is magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing (the same type as the weapon it is applied to), and makes your weapon considered iron for the purpose of damaging fey or creatures affected by the Blood Curse of Shackling.

**Amplify**. The cursed creature is also considered vulnerable to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from weapons made of iron for the duration.

</div>


### Lesser Fey Aspect
 *7th-level feature*

You become more in tune with the fey creatures you hunt, and your hunter's bane allows you to draw on the latent magic of the feywild. you gain the following effects:



- You have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed. When you get the Hardened Soul feature at 9th level, you instead gain immunity to the charmed condition.

- When a creature takes the disengage action or teleports away from you to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, you can use your ***reaction*** to teleport up to 60 feet to an empty space you can see adjacent to them.
- You can use an ***action*** to gain truesight out to a range of 10 feet for 10 minutes. Once you do so, you must complete a long rest before you can do so again.

### Graceful Reproach
 *11th-level feature*

You gain the ability to match even the unearthly martial graces of the fey. When you have a Crimson Rite active and a creature makes a weapon attack against you, you can use your ***reaction*** to deal your rite damage to that creature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Magic Resistance
 *15th-level feature*

You have become so attuned to the feywild that it's infused your physiology with magic, granting you innate understanding and resistance against the arcane. You have advantage on saving throws against magical effects.

### Heartless Hunter
 *18th-level feature*

Your heart hardens into a gemstone, and you no longer need it to survive. As an ***action***, you can remove your heart from your body, or return it to your chest, taking 1d12 piercing damage that cannot be reduced in any way when you do.

While heartless, the effects of the poisoned, exhausted, and paralyzed conditions are suppressed (and time passed while heartless does not count against the duration of said conditions), you are resistant to fire, cold, force, and psychic damage, and you cannot take or gain the benefits of short or long rests.

While removed, your heart is a fist sized ruby worth about 1000gp, with an AC of 20 and 30 hit points, and is immune to all damage except force, bludgeoning, and psychic, to which it is vulnerable. If your heart is destroyed, you die. If a creature holding your heart casts any spell on you, you automatically fail the saving throw. This includes spells you are normally immune to.


If a spell, effect, or damage would instantly kill you, even if it destroys your body, your heart will remain, and a *revivify*, or a more powerful spell of similar effect will return you to life at one hit point, without requiring any material components. Similarly, if you drop to 0 hit points with your heart inside your body, you are considered stable until you take damage, at which point you would resume making death saving throws.

</div>

Of all the monster hunter traditions, the tradition of the Inquisition is the most accepted by the rulers and organized religions. Sometimes even working closely with those institutions, the Inquisition has been given much leeway in their fight against corruption.

Most traditions specialize in hunting down different monsters, threats to humanity. However, the followers of this tradition understand that humanity themselves are the true monsters. The biggest threats to an orderly and peaceful society come from within, and these must be cut out of the society like the cancer they are.

During this time, your speed is increased by 10 feet, you resist non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and your crimson rite deals one additional Crimson Rite die of damage. This state ends early if you fall unconscious.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.

**Amplify**. The fire damage is dealt to all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the cursed creature.

</div>

The process of consuming the Hunter's Bane is a painful, scarring, and often fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one's own physiology through corrupted alchemy.

Over generations of experimentation, a splinter group of monster hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time become something beyond human. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant.




### Mutagen Craft
 *1st-level feature*

You have been taught forbidden alchemical formulas that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities. These mutagens are designed for your biology and have no effect on other creatures, instead giving them the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

It takes an hour to concoct a single mutagen. They are unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next long rest.

Consuming a mutagen requires a ***bonus action***, and the effects (including side effects) last until you start a long rest or you take 10 minutes to meditate and flush the toxins from your system.

Your body will begin to better utilize the toxins you instill it with as you grow in power and experience. These advancing mutations may be signified by a Mutation score.

 **Mutation Score** = class level divided by 4, rounded up.

 *11th-level feature*

You can use a ***bonus action*** to instill a burst of adrenaline to temporarily resist the negative effects of a mutagen. You can choose to ignore the side effect of a mutagen affecting you until the end of your next turn.

</div>

The darkness that creeps through the world is deep, foul and brimming with unspeakable horror. Many a monster hunter sets out upon their crusade with vigor and zeal in their heart, yet the abominations from beyond and the corruption from within cause them to lose their way. It is so easy to forget what you fight for, to become so tainted that everything bleeds together. Followers of the Peerless Flame never forget.

The Peerless Flame is the fire of creation that burns radiant within all living things. Followers of this tradition have submitted themselves to the transformative properties of the monter hunter so that they may tap into their own connection with the Peerless Flame without it searing their form away. They are the polaris of humanity, guardians and guides towards a brighter future and some of the few monster hunters that manage to keep a positive outlook in this bleak world.




### Exalted Firebrand

Upon joining this order you now speak with the passion and authority that only the Peerless Flame can grant you. You have proficiency with Charisma checks when trying to influence non-evil humanoids.

The ash required for your wards requires a long rest to create and will supply you with enough ash for five ward applications. Every 24 hours it is not applied one application’s worth of the ash is rendered inert.

An applied ward is dormant until activated by its bearer, and when activated, it lasts for 1 hour. If not used before the next long rest, a ward will dissipate.

A creature can only have one ward applied. If multiple wards are applied, only the last can be activated. After activating a ward, the creature can not have a new award applied until after completing a long rest.

At 11th level, the amount of wards that a creature can have applied and active simultaneously increases to two, and at 15th level that increases to three.

Most wards require an ability check against DC 12 when activated in order to avoid negative effects. You always have advantage on this check.

The burning hatred of the monstrosities who seek to harm those you protect has only grown.

The magics adopted by the wayward monster hunters prove formidable against many an evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance. These fiends were far trickier to hunt, and many lost their lives in pursuit of such wickedness.

This tradition has chosen to delve into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge and making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outweighted the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've the attention of the Hunters of the Profane Soul.




### Rite Focus
 *1st-level feature*

When you choose choose to follow this tratition, you strike a bargain with an otherworldy being selected from the warlock class description. When the pact is sealed, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron.

Your patron enhances your crimson rite in the following ways:

- If you deal rite damage to a creature, it loses invisibility until the beginning of your next turn.
- When you kill a hostile creature with a weapon attack while having an active rite, you regain hit points equal to your Crimson Rite damage die.
- Whenever you deal a critical hit to a creature while having an active rite, you can use a ***bonus action*** to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Sworn enemy
 *1st-level feature*

To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish or long rest.

#### Spells Known
Initially you know two 1st level spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. A spell must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Spell Level column.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for your warlock spells.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Spellcasting focus
You can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your spells.

### Mystic Frenzy
 *7th-level feature*

When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a ***bonus action***.

### Diabolic Channel
 *11th-level feature*

You can temporarily infuse your rite with the seed of a powerful spell. As an ***action***, you can imbue your rite-enhanced weapon with one spell you can cast or is already active, then make a single attack with that weapon.

If that attack hits, all spell attack rolls for the imbued spell hit the target automatically and are considered part of the single weapon attack. The target takes weapon damage, and is subject to the effects of the spell, expending a spell slot accordingly. If the attack has advantage, the target's initial saving throw against the spell has disadvantage. If the attack misses, the spell has no effect. Area spells originate from the target's space.

The spell must be of 1st level or higher, have a casting time of 1 action, or require an action to activate an already active concentration spell.



### Mystic Arcanum
 *11h-level feature*

Your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 4th level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At 15th level, you gain a 5th level warlock spell that can be cast in this way. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### Soul Syphon
 *18th-level feature*

You learn to sacrifice the souls of powerful foes to your dark patron in exchange for immediate power. When you reduce a creature with a challenge rating of 15 or above to 0 hit points with an attack, you recover an expended spell slot.
