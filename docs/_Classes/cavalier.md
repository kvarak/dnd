While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause.

A cavalier is more than just a mere warrior, but a vessel of courage surrounded by armor of chivalry and honor. Whether they are selling their services to lords in a mercenary knighthood roaming the realm or dedicated servants of a castle, cavaliers all share a sense of honor and dignity. Most are nobles, raised to follow in the footsteps of their fathers or mothers who were cavaliers before them.

Others are fortunate souls who were taken on as squires to service in the cavalier’s order at a young age. Bonds of kinship with adventurers or other cavaliers are a common motivating factor for a cavalier. The cavalier stands strong in the face of threats to allies
and the cavalier’s order.


### Honorable Combat
Cavaliers learn the art of combat with restraint. A cavalier must follow a code of honor, and fights with honor in combat to gain honor and respect. Cavaliers never strike an unarmed foe, nor will they attack a foe that is unable to defend themselves in battle. Cavaliers always fight with honor, and are specialized in honorable challenges at arms.

### Chivalry
A cavalier always acts in accordance with the strictest tenets of honor and follows a personal code of chivalry. Cavaliers act with caution and care not to harm those who cannot defend themselves, nor do they strike a foe unprepared. Honorable combat is the only form of combat known to a cavalier, even when it is to the cavalier’s personal detriment. Cavaliers are dedicated to the cause of chivalry, and their order. As trained soldiers, they are taught to bring honor to themselves, their families, and their order or kingdom.



### Adventuring
An adventuring cavalier often uses their training on their adventures across the world, bringing honor and renown to the order that trained them, as well as safety to those in need. A cavalier is driven by a sense of duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves and to fight against those who threaten innocent people.

### Challenge
Your dauntless fighting spirit and force of personality invokes awe in your allies and fear in the hearts of enemies.

As a ***bonus action***, you step forward and challenge a foe. To challenge an enemy, the foe must have an Intelligence of 5 or higher and speak or understand at least one language. Body language alone can convey the intention of this challenge, at the discretion of the DM.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you. A foe may only be affected by your challenge once per day.

Your melee attacks deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier against the target of your challenge. Some cavalier orders grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the order description.

In addition, while challenging a foe, you and all allies within 3o ft have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

The challenge lasts for one minute, unless a challenge ability states otherwise. The effect also ends if you attack any other creature besides the target or if you are rendered unconscious.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


<div class="card rest">

</div>



### Mounted Expert
Your mounted training allows you to effectively control a mount in the chaos of battle. This grants you several benefits.
* You gain proficiency with Animal Handling.
* You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount.
* If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.
* Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

#### Steed
You may select a mount that becomes your Steed. It uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a steed also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. For each level you gain after 2nd, your steed gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.

The Steed obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can command the steed where to move (no action required by you). You can use your ***action*** to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action.

Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.








If your steed dies or is otherwise lost, you can obtain another one by spending 1 week bonding with another mount.

### Combat Superiority
Starting at 2nd level, your tactical expertise makes you a deadly force on the battlefield. You learn maneuvers which are fueled by a special resource called superiority.

#### Maneuvers
You learn three maneuvers of your choice. At least half (rounded down) of you maneuvers must be from the mounted category.

You learn additional maneuvers at certain levels as shown in the Maneuvers Known section of the Cavalier table. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. All maneuvers are listed *<a href="#internal-maneuvers">here</a>*.

In addition you always have access to the ***Action Surge*** maneuver (see below)

Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

#### Superiority
To use a maneuver, you have to spend ***Superiority***. Most maneuvers require you to spend 2 superiority, some cost only 1, and the action surge maneuver costs 4. The amount of superiority you have per level as shown in the Cavalier table.

#### Superiority Dice
Some maneuvers have effects based on your superiority die. You start with a d6, and it increases as you level, as shown in the Cavalier table.


<img src='https://robertrigo.github.io/assets/images/cavalier.png' style='float:right;width:37%;padding:20px' />



#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

#### Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can spend ***4 superiority*** to take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

### Second Wind
From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, if you have less than half your hp left, you can use a ***bonus action*** to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your Constitution bonus.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.


### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Indomitable
At 9th level, you can choose either *Indomitable self* or *Indomitable ally*.

When you use the feature you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times starting at 17th level.

#### Indomitable Self
As a ***reaction***, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.

#### Indomitable Ally
Your courageous words inspire valor and ferocity in your allies, allowing you to use your ***reaction*** to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see or hear you to reroll a failed saving throw.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**. To qualify for multiclassing into the cavalier class, you must meet these prerequisites: Strength 13

**Proficiencies**. When you multiclass into the cavalier class, you gain the following proficiencies: Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons
