# Paladin
Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline.

As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

A paladin is a living embodiment of an oath — a promise or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior who has the skill and the determination to see the cause through to the end. Some paladins devote themselves expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading justice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing them under the rule of law.

Although no paladin in the world could be described as typical, a number of them are narrowminded do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid in their attitudes — if only to keep from alienating their companions.

It’s important to keep in mind that most paladins aren’t robots. They have doubts and prejudices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any other character does. Some are compelled by an internal motivation that might sometimes be at odds with the principles of their oaths.












<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-darkpaladin">The Dark Paladin</a></h2>


Paladins are undisputed heroes and champions of noble causes. These brave knights walk a lonely road, maligned for being “too uptight,” or “Lawful Stupid” by their less scrupulous companions. Yet despite their renowned moral code, paladins can still succumb to the darkness that tempts all living creatures.

The following roleplaying prompts and class features are perfect for Evil paladins, but can be used by any paladin who chooses to stray from the straight and narrow path.

### The Doors of Darkness
Darkness enters a paladin’s heart through the flaws in his or her personality. Flaws are prompts for exploring how the paladin goes astray. They are the corruptions of the proper paladin virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom.

#### Aggression
Aggressive paladins have a penchant for dominance and destruction. Many suffer wounds of the heart and mind. A wrathful paladin’s blood boils
so hot that they lose their divine virtues in a haze of fury.

| d8 | Flaw |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | Few things satisfy my sadistic urges as well as smiting my enemies. |
| 2 | I take my anger out on others, even if they are not personally to blame. |
| 3 | In the fight against Evil, collateral damage is the sign of a worthy battle. |
| 4 | Once I get angry, I cannot stop myself from yelling. |
| 5 | It excites me to toy with foes that I’ve cornered or challenged to a duel. |
| 6 | I lay awake at night thinking about how I will kill my enemies. |
| 7 | I am righteous. Therefore, I never compromise. |
| 8 | Only the weak confide their worries. Only the false confess their sins. |



#### Naïveté
Naive paladins are unfamiliar with the ways of the world. Their actions are well intended, but in their haste for justice they bite off more than they can chew. Those who lack diligence or patience may find themselves accessory to a villain’s plot. Soft-hearted paladins will someday discover the brutality of their profession, and the wisdom to accept that is hard-won.

| d8 | Flaw |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | I think everyone wants to be a loyal subject of the law, and I must teach them how. |
| 2 | I find the teachings of my oath, faith, or order confusing and disorienting.
| 3 | Critical thinking hurts! I avoid it by reciting catechisms. |
| 4 | I am guided on the path of righteousness, so my plans needn’t account for failure. |
| 5 | I rarely interact with people outside my faith or community. |
| 6 | Nobody understands my burden; I regularly tell them so. |
| 7 | I find no peace in quiet moments; my thoughts return to the lives I couldn’t save.|
| 8 | Even in my dreams, I cannot escape the carnage I wreak in the name of virtue. |

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10

#### Saving Throws
You are proficient with ***Wisdom*** and ***Charisma*** saving throws.

#### Skills
**Class Skills:** Animal handling *(only specific mount, such as camel, dog or horse)*, Leadership, Physique, Religion and Speechcraft

**Skill Points:** You gain 2 skill points at 1st level.

#### Skills - Combat
**Weapon Groups:** You have rank 2 with Axe, Club, Flail, Lance, Spear, Sword and Bow. Additionally you have rank 1 with Knife, Polearm and Crossbow.

**Combat Skills:** You gain the *Light armor*, *Medium armor* and *Heavy armor* skills.

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an ***action***, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend or undead within 60 ft, not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of being, but not its identity.

Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell.

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Sacred Oath
Your oath is a sacred vow which separates you from any common knight — it is what makes you a paladin. At 1st level, choose your oath and begin living by its tenets.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

In addition, some oaths may grant additional choices for your feature, like divine blessing, channel divinity and prayers. Those will be described in the oath description at the appropriate level (1st, 9th, 13th and 17th).

### Sacred Touch
Drawing strength from your divine power, you can harm or bless those you come in contact with. This power is represented by a pool of Devotion equal to ***twice your class level***.

You can spend Devotion to use the Divine Blessing, Lay on Hands and Divine Smite abilities listed below. The maximum number of Devotion you can spend at a time on an ability equals your proficiency bonus.

When you finish a long rest, you can choose to regain some of your expended Devotion.

#### Strength of Devotion
Some of your class features require saving throws. The saving throw DC for all those is calculated as follows:

**Save DC**  = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Divine Blessing
Using your weapon as a focus, you raise it towards the sky as an ***action***, while shouting a forceful intent. The intent can be anything appropriate to your oath, like *“For the Crown!”*, *“In the name of Justice!”* or even *“By the power of Grayskull!”*.

A divine blessing can initially only be used on yourself, and require you to spend one or more Devotion from your pool. A blessing counts as divine magic and lasts for 1 hour unless otherwise stated, or until you lose concentration.

<div class="columns">

- ***Blessing of Certainty***. For ***1 minute***, when you make an attack roll or saving throw, roll a d4 and add the number rolled.
- ***Blessing of Courage***. You are immune to being frightened.
- ***Blessing of Defiance***. Gain advantage on a saving throw type of your choice.
- ***Blessing of Heroism***. For ***1 minute***, at the start of each of your turns, roll a d4 for each Devotion spent and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total.
- ***Blessing of Vigor***. As long as you are conscious and below half your hit point maximum, you regain a number of hit points at the start of your turn equal to the number of Devotion spent.
- ***Divine Favor***. For ***1 minute*** your weapon attacks deal an extra d4 radiant damage on a hit.
- ***Magic Weapon***. Your weapon becomes a +1 weapon.
. ***Protection from Evil***. Aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition you can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.
- ***Shield of Faith***. A shimmering field surrounds you, granting a +2 bonus to AC.

</div>

#### Lay on Hands
As an ***action***, you can touch a creature and spend Devotion in order to heal its injuries. Roll a d8 for each Devotion you spend and restore a number of hit points to the creature equal to the total + your Charisma modifier. This ability has no effect on undead and constructs.

You can use this as a ***reaction*** on yourself when you are reduced to 0 hp. When doing so, you need to spend twice the Devotion for the same effect.

Alternatively, when you spend Devotion to use this ability, you can forgo rolling one of those dice to instead cure the target of a disease, remove a curse, or neutralize a poison affecting it. Some diseases or curses may require several dice to cure, or even be beyond your capability.

#### Divine Smite
When you attack a creature with a melee weapon, you can spend Devotion to further wound the target. If you miss, the Devotion is not spent. Otherwise, roll a d8 for each Devotion and deal the total as extra radiant damage in addition to the weapon's damage. If the target is a fiend or an undead, it takes an additional d8 damage.

Alternatively, when you spend Devotion to use this ability, you can forgo rolling 4 of those dice to instead attempt to **Banish** the target.

<div class="feat">

## Banish
You attempt to send the target to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there as long as you concentrate, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If you can keep concentration for 1 minute, the target doesn't return. Otherwise, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

</div>

### Bless ally
Your divine blessings can be used to bless others. By placing your palm on a creature and uttering a short prayer as an ***action***, you can spend one or more Devotion and grant one of your blessings to it.

When doing so, you can additionally expend an equal amount of Devotion to bless yourself as well, and/or expend an equal amount and place your other palm on one additional target.

You are still restricted to using a maximum number of Devotion equal to your proficiency bonus at the same time.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the <a href="fighter.html#internal-FightingStyles">fighting style options from the Fighter class description</a>. In addition, the *Blessed Warrior* style is also added to your options.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

<div class="feat">

## Blessed Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from a cleric spell list appropriate to your oath. They count as paladin spells for you. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the same spell list.

</div>


### Prayer
A prayer is a way to prepare your mind against the struggles ahead. It can be a prayer to a deity that is guiding you, or a mantra you use to focus, or some other kind of ritual you perform. It takes at least 10 minutes to perform a prayer. If you want to affect another creature with your prayer, it needs to attend, but not necessarily as an active participant.

The number of prayers you know are equal to your proficiency modifier, and whenever you gain a new Paladin level you can replace a prayer with a new one. All prayers are listed at the <a href="#internal-prayer">end of the class description</a>.

If a prayer requires a saving throw, use your Devotion DC.

### Channel Divinity
Your sacred vows allow you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You know **two** Channel Divinity options from the <a href="#internal-channel">list</a> at the end of the class description, and additionally one or more determined by your oath. When you gain a new Paladin level you can replace one of your Channel Divinity options with a new one, but you cannot replace one provided by your oath.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all uses after a long rest.

If your Channel Divinity requires a saving throw, use your Devotion DC.

**To Channel**. Unless otherwise mentioned, channeling divinity takes an ***action***, and you can affect yourself and/or creatures of your choice within 30 ft that you can see. You can always target yourself, and the maximum number of additional creatures you can target equals your proficiency bonus.

### Divine Health
By 4th level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to most mundane diseases. However, your immunity is not absolute. Your capability to withstand a disease depends on its strength.

| Paladin Level | Immunity |
|:-------------:|:---------|
| 01-05 | Diseases up to DC 15
| 06-10 | Diseases up to DC 20
| 11-15 | Diseases up to DC 25
| 16-20 | All diseases

<!--
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
-->

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 5th level, you gain new ways to impart your divine power unto a creature. As an ***action***, you can touch a willing creature (which can include yourself) and end one effect on the creature causing it to be blinded or deafened.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain uses after a long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain additional ways to use this feature. Starting at 8th level, you can end an effect on the target causing it to be paralyzed or stunned and at 12th level, you can end one spell on the target.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 ft makes a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
From 9th level you gain access to additional blessings. In addition some oaths gain access to other features.

To use one of the following blessings, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

<div class="columns">


- ***Aura of Vitality***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. For ***1 minute***, healing energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30 ft radius. The aura moves with you, and you can use a ***bonus action*** to cause one creature in the aura (including you) to regain 2d6 hit points

- ***Crusader's Mantle***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. For ***1 minute***, holy power radiates from you in an aura with a 30 ft radius, awakening boldness in friendly creatures. The aura moves with you, and each ally in the aura (including you) deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage when it hits with a weapon attack.

- ***Magic shield***. For ***1 minute***, while wielding your shield, you have some protection against spells with a spell level equal to the number of Devotion spent and lower. Against such spells you have advantage on saving throws and ranged spells that require an attack roll are made at disadvantage.

- ***Warrior's Blessing***. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage.

</div>

### Aura of Courage
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 ft can’t be frightened while you are conscious. If a friendly creature is frightened when it enters your aura, the effect is suspended while it remains within the aura.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Divine Strikes
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or an unarmed strike, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

### Strengthening the Divine
From 13th level you gain access to additional blessings. In addition some oaths gain access to other features.

The following blessings can only be used on yourself, and to use them you must spend at least 4 Devotion.

<div class="columnsthree">

- ***Aura of Divine Censure***. For ***1 minute*** you radiate a 30 ft radius holy aura that is anathema to undead and fiends. Any undead or fiend that enters the aura or begins its turn in the aura takes 2d6 radiant damage and must make a Charisma saving throw; if the saving throw fails, the creature must move out of the aura as soon as it can.

- ***Aura of Life***. Life-preserving energy radiates from you in a 30 ft radius aura. Each ally in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can't be reduced. In addition, an allied creature regains 1 hit point when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points.

- ***Aura of Purity***. Purifying energy radiates from you in a 30 ft radius aura. Each ally in the aura (including you) can’t become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.
</div>

### Aura of Conviction
Starting at 14th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 ft can't be charmed while you are conscious. If a friendly creature is charmed when it enters your aura, the effect is suspended while it remains within the aura.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
From 17th level you gain access to additional blessings. In addition some oaths gain access to other features.

The following blessings can only be used on yourself, and to use them you must spend at least 5 Devotion.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Circle of Power***. Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and diffusing magical energy within 30 ft. Each friendly creature in the area (including you) has advantage on saving throws against magical effects. Additionally, when an affected creature succeeds on a saving throw made against a magical effect that allows a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds.

- ***Holy Weapon***. You imbue your weapon with holy power. It emits bright light in a 30 ft radius and dim light for an additional 30 ft. In addition, it deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

    As a ***bonus action***, you can dismiss the Holy weapon blessing and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 ft must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a new saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

</div>






<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-channel">Channel Divinity options</a></h2>

Your sacred vows allow you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You know **two** Channel Divinity options from below, and additionally one or more determined by your oath. When you gain a new Paladin level you can replace one of your Channel Divinity options with a new one, but you cannot replace the one provided by your oath.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all uses after a long rest.

**To Channel**. Unless otherwise mentioned, channeling divinity takes an ***action***, and you can affect yourself and/or creatures of your choice within 30 ft that you can see. You can always target yourself, and the maximum number of additional creatures you can target equals your proficiency bonus.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### By the Light of the Watchful Moon
    Regardless of the time of day, you command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats. Within 90 ft from you, shafts of bright moonlight shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all threats for 1 minute, whether they’re enemies seen or unseen, traps or hidden hazards.

    An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s soft glow. The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but it does mark the invisible creature’s location. The light moves with targets while the effect lasts, but targets that move out of the original radius are no longer illuminated.

- #### Rally
    You rally your allies. Each target may spend a number of Hit Dice up to your proficiency bonus, if any are available, and make one saving throw against an ongoing effect that it is suffering from.

- #### Compelled Duel
    As a ***bonus action***, you compel creatures into a duel. Targeted creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. While affected they have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this prayer doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.

    The effect ends after 1 minute, if you lose concentration, if you attack a creature not affected by this prayer or if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it.


- #### Suppress Pain
    You dull the pain of your and your allies’ wounds and help them tolerate further punishment. Roll a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target creature that is not undead or construct heals that amount of hp and also gains temporary hit points equal to the roll.

</div>

### Available from level 9
The following channel divinity options can be selected when you reach 9th level of the Paladin class.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Magic Circle
    You create a 10 ft radius, 20 ft tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a target point on the ground within 30 ft, and lasts for an hour. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose one of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

    -- It can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If it tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. <br/>
    -- It has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.<br/>
    -- Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

    You can elect to cause this divine circle to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

- #### Dispel Magic
    For the purposes of this effect you can additionally target objects or magical effects. You end any spell of 3rd level or lower on the targets. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make a Charisma ability check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

- #### Return to Earth
    Corporeal undead targets take 5d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. An undead reduced to 0 hit points crumbles to dust.

</div>

### Available from level 17
The following channel divinity options can be selected when you reach 17th level of the Paladin class.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Destructive Wave
    Striking the ground you create a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 ft must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

</div>


<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-prayer">Prayers</a></h2>

A prayer is a way to prepare your mind against the struggles ahead. It can be a prayer to a deity that is guiding you, or a mantra you use to focus, or some other kind of ritual you perform. It takes at least 10 minutes to perform a prayer. If you want to affect another creature with your prayer, it needs to attend, but not necessarily as an active participant.

The number of prayers you know are equal to your proficiency modifier, and whenever you gain a new Paladin level you can replace a prayer with a new one.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Blessed Watchfulness
    You or one willing creature is kept wide awake and alert for 8 hrs, allowing them to stand guard without fear of falling asleep. The creature will not suffer any exhaustion due to missed sleep. In addition, the target has advantage on *Perception* checks made while on guard. A creature may not be affected by this prayer another time until it has had a full night’s sleep.

- #### Find Steed
    You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.  While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

    Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, any blessing that targets only you also target your steed.

    When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, performing this prayer again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.  You can’t have more than one steed bonded at a time.

- #### Gentle Repose
    You pray over a corpse or other remains. For 30 days the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead. This also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this prayer do not count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.

- #### Locate Object
    During your prayer you focus on an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. With this prayer you can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close at least once, or locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

- #### Prayer of Resolve
    Your allies are bolstered with toughness and resolve. Choose a number of creatures up to your level. Each target’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 until their next long rest.

- #### Recall Death
    You pray over a corpse that has been dead for 24 hours or less and receive a vision of the final moments of its life. During the time of your prayer, you are incapacitated because you are in a trance, seeing a vision of the last ten minutes of the corpse's life as seen by the subject itself. The vision ends with the last thing the subject saw before it died, at which time you awaken.

</div>

### Prayers available from level 9
The following prayers can be chosen when you reach 9th level of the Paladin class.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Daylight
    A 60 ft radius sphere of light spreads out from your position or an object you have focused on during your prayer. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 ft. The light remains until the start of your next long rest, or until you dismiss it. If any of this light’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

- #### Death Ward
    Your prayer grants a measure of protection from death until the start of your next long rest. The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the effect ends. If the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the effect ends. A creature may not be affected by this prayer again until it has had a full night’s sleep.

- #### Revivify
    You pray over a creature that has died within the last couple of minutes, anointing it with 200 gp worth of rare oils. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. All mortal wounds are closed, but missing body parts are not restored. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the prayer automatically fails.

    The prayer does not remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed, they take effect when the creature returns to life. An undead creature can not be restored to life, nor a creature that has died of old age.

- #### Zone of Truth
    Your prayer creates a magical zone that guards against deception in an immobile 15 ft radius. For 1 hour, a creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

    An affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

</div>

### Prayers available from level 13
The following prayers can be chosen when you reach 13th level of the Paladin class.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Find Greater Steed
    As Find Steed, but the spirit can take on additional forms: griffon, pegasus, peryton, dire wolf, rhinoceros or saber-toothed tiger.

- #### Locate Creature
    As Locate Object, but you can sense a creature, specific or of a certain type.

</div>

### Prayers available from level 17
The following prayers can be chosen when you reach 17th level of the Paladin class.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Geas
    You place a divine command on a target creature present during the prayer, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide for a period of 30 days.

    If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day.

    A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell. You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death.

- #### Raise Dead
    As Revivify, but works on a creature that has been dead for up to 10 days, and the sacred oil must be made with even more expensive components, worth 500 gp. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

    Coming back from the dead this way is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

</div>



<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-oaths">Sacred Oaths</a></h2>


Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to a cause. The sacred oath is the culmination of all the paladin's training. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.

### The 'Classic' Paladin
The most common oaths are for a cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. They are often called white knights or holy warriors, meeting the ideal of a knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good.

The oaths in this group all strive to become an ideal; a clarion call in the darkness and the voice of a leader in the darkest of times.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-courage">Oath of Courage</a>**.  You see it as your duty to give people around you the hope, the confidence, and the tools to fight alongside you. A beacon in the darkness capable of bolstering those who are frightened, and the voice of a leader.

- **<a href="#internal-benevolence">Oath of Benevolence</a>**.  Find comfort in hope and purpose in love, acting as friends to all living things: outcast, royal, beast, and mortal alike.

- **<a href="#internal-devotion">Oath of Devotion</a>.**  This oath binds a paladin to the highest standards of conduct, following the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Some, for better or worse, also hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

- **<a href="#internal-guardian">Oath of the Guardian</a>.**  You have sworn to defend of those who cannot defend themselves.

- **<a href="#internal-leadership">Oath of Leadership</a>.**  This oath calls to paladins who seek to be the first one to raise their weapon in the face of danger and destruction.

- **<a href="#internal-martyrdom">Oath of Martyrdom</a>.**  The most selfless of oaths. A paladin who dedicates his life in taking the suffering from others.

- **<a href="#internal-redemption">Oath of Redemption</a>.**  These paladins believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk.

</div>

### Paladins of the Natural World
Paladins who swear these oaths cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the natural world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice.

They focus on promoting the freedom of individuals, and encourage the chaos of the natural world.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-anarchy">Oath of Anarchy</a>.** These paladins believe in the liberty of chaos; rules and authority are dangerous things. They dislike conquest of the wilderness, preferring that people live with nature, not against it.

- **<a href="#internal-ancients">Oath of the Ancients</a>.** Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath have a close connection to the fey and nature.

- **<a href="#internal-waves">Oath of the Waves</a>.**  Paladins who follow gods of the ocean or who are born among marine races often follow this oath.

</div>

### Paladins of other Ideals
Just as the more common paladins, followers of these oaths are sworn to an ideal. However, the ideals are not necessarily the pursuit of justice or the greater good.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-balance">Oath of Balance</a>.**  These paladins choose to step back from the conflict between good, evil, law, and chaos, believing alliance with any extreme only blinds one to the truths of the universe.

- **<a href="#internal-freshness">Oath of Freshness</a>**.  These paladins have sworn their oaths to deities of music and beauty, emphasizing that people should be happy and not take life too seriously.

- **<a href="#internal-lyan">Oath of the Lyan</a>.**  Sworn to uphold lawfulness in all senses and believe in the value of deference, honor, and trustworthiness, with little interest in matters of good and evil.

- **<a href="#internal-radiance">Oath of Radiance</a>.**  Paladins who focus on the concept of truth.

- **<a href="#internal-tomorrow">Oath of Tomorrow</a>.**  Those who swear the oath of tomorrow believe in the virtue of progress and strive to push the world forward, opposing reactionaries who would stand against such.

- **<a href="#internal-tradition">Oath of Tradition</a>.**  Those who swear this oath recognize the value of history, of lore, of the past, and are protectors of traditional institutions as well as keepers of those stories that would otherwise be forgotten.

</div>

### Paladins in Service
Most paladins serve some kind of ideal or idea, but the following serve a specific deity, organization or group.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-bastion">Oath of the Bastion</a>.**  Swearing to defend their charge at any cost, these paladins make it their duty to protect a sacred location, a holy relic, or a group of people.

- **<a href="#internal-crown">Oath of the Crown</a>.**  Sworn to the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership.

</div>

### Defenders Against Threat
Some oaths have been sworn in the defense of the world against a specific threat. Such a paladin is just as much devoted to the paths of justice and the greater good, but they often see the monsters they are fighting to be the greatest threat.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-elderSign">Oath of the Elder Sign</a>.**  Sworn to defend this reality from the horrors of the Far realm.

- **<a href="#internal-grave">Oath of the Grave</a>.**  A guardian of the dead, sworn to defend their right to eternal rest and to return the undead to their graves.

</div>

### Darker Paladins
The paladins in this group often do not not notice when they have crossed the line, when they come to a point that common folk are more afraid of them than the evil they are fighting. In their minds they are still doing the right thing.

<div class="columns">

- **<a href="#internal-conquest">Oath of Conquest</a>.**  These paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies, seeing that as more important that why they are doing it.

- **<a href="#internal-purge">Oath of the Purge</a>.**  Dictates that impurity must be cleansed by fire and annihilated completely.

- **<a href="#internal-supremacy">Oath of Supremacy</a>.**  Paladins who proclaim the moral supremacy of any single cause, such as their faith, ideal, leader, movement, order, race, or sect.

- **<a href="#internal-vengeance">Oath of Vengeance</a>.**  A solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin.

</div>

### Restricted Oaths
Some oaths are restricted, and only available to specific folk. This can be due to physical attributes only existing in those kinds of folk, or a due to cultural differences.

In the second case, the oath wold not be available if you grew up completely outside the folks'  typical culture, while a member of a completely different folk would have access to it if growing up within the culture.

<div class="columns">

- #### Awakened
    **<a href="#internal-revenant">Oath of the Revenant</a>** *(Awakened only)*. This oath is one that is  not necessarily chosen voluntarily. Paladins sworn to this oath live only to complete a definite goal given to them by their creators, and once it is complete their soul can finally return to the afterlife.

- #### Dhampir
    **<a href="#internal-blood">Oath of Blood</a>** *(Dhampir only)*. You are more Vampire than Dhampir. Rather than falling to it, you called upon the divine nature of a paladin’s oath to keep your curse at bay, and swore to use your dark nature in the service of a cause.

- #### Dwarf
    **<a href="#internal-stonelord">Stonelord</a>** *(Dwarf only)*. A stonelord is a devoted sentinel of dwarven enclaves, who has strengthened their connection to the ground, drawing power from the earth and ancient stone to protect their people.

- #### Eladrin
    **<a href="#internal-festivity">Oath of Festivity</a>**. This oath appeals to eladrin paladins with an unquenchable zest for life and the need to spread it to others. When times are darkest and gloom casts a shadow over the people, these paladins are there to bring joy back into the lives of their comrades and allies.

- #### Halfling
    **<a href="#internal-festivity">Oath of Festivity</a>**. This oath appeals to halfling paladins with an unquenchable zest for life and the need to spread it to others. When times are darkest and gloom casts a shadow over the people, these paladins are there to bring joy back into the lives of their comrades and allies.

- #### Kenku
    **<a href="#internal-wingSeeker">Oath of the Wing seeker</a>** *(Kenku only)*. This oath focuses on the quest to end the plight that has plagued their race, and these paladins will follow any god or mission if it gets them closer to unravel the mysteries of their own past and to break the curse that looms over them.

</div>

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-anarchy">Oath of Anarchy</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Chaos Strike, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: Primeval Speech |
| 7th | Aura of Impunity |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 20th | Limitless Power

</div>

Traditionally sworn to oneself, a comrade, or the wilderness itself, the Oath of Anarchy binds a paladin to protect freedom and nature against tyranny and control. These paladins believe in the liberty of chaos; rules and authority are dangerous things, nothing more than the chains that separate people from each other and bind them down against their own desires. People are best off trusted to make their own decisions and learn to peacefully coexist in freedom.

In addition to promoting the freedom of individuals, bearers of this oath also encourage the chaos of the natural world. They dislike conquest of the wilderness, preferring that people live with nature, not against it. In the eyes of many of these paladins, the world was as it was meant to be when it was first made, without the changes wrought by mortal hands. Called fantra, after the Sylvan word for guardian, these paladins are keepers of chaos and defenders of disorder, sworn to uphold their values even to bloodshed.

> *"We need the tonic of wildness... at the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious... that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature."*
>
> -- Henry David Thoreau, Walden

#### Tenets of Anarchy
As advocates against formal rules, there are no uniform tenets for the paladins of Anarchy. Nevertheless, their commitment to chaos can be summarized roughly as follows.

 **Anarchy**. The rigidity of institutions ought to be rejected wherever possible. Authority is an agent of separation and oppression, and power is best left in the hands of people.

 **Relativism**. Good and evil are sophistries and opinions, and the only true measure of right is peaceful, free coexistence. People should determine on their own and amongst each other how they ought to conduct themselves, not lawmakers, kings, or judges.

 **Earth**. The natural world is the ultimate symbol of freedom and coexistence, and it must be protected against those agents of law which would abuse and destroy it.

 **Autonomy**. Use your own judgment and encourage others to use theirs. Commit acts that fulfill your oath and acts that please you. Feel no duty to that which accomplishes neither.

 **Equity**. Respect the autonomy and desires of others, their personal chaos. Acknowledge the inherent worth of each mortal and their freedoms. Hierarchy is always the path to tyranny; equity will always restore freedom.

#### Anarchic Witnesses
As part of its espousal of natural chaos, the Oath of Anarchy has no formal orders or official fellowships. Because of this, the divine witness before or to whom a fantra swears is often a very personally significant decision. Who did you swear your Oath of Anarchy before? Consider some of the suggestions on the following table, or come up with an idea of your own.

| 1d6 | Anarchic Witness |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | You stood before a beautiful vista and poured your heart out to the wilds and all its natural treasures.
| 2 | To make your oath, you sought out an ancient druid who guarded the wilderness of your homeland.
| 3 | You and a friend swore the Oath of Anarchy with each other as the only witnesses you needed.
| 4 | A fey queen recognized the valor of your quest, and she sealed your oath as an otherworldly witness.
| 5 | You decided that the only witness you need is yourself. Your commitment is yours alone.
| 6 | A tyrant was your only witness as you swore to someday end his rule and liberate the domain.

<div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

### Paladin Feature Change
The Oath of Anarchy is sworn by paladins dedicated to struggling in behalf of chaos against law. Such paladins may thus be disinterested with the conflicts of good and evil and even disregard them. The following features are changed when you take this oath:

#### Channel Divinity
If you select the Magic Circle Channel Option, it instead functions against constructs, devils and other lawfully aligned extraplanar creatures.

#### Detect Law
When you use your Divine Sense, you detect the presence of constructs, devils and other lawfully aligned extraplanar creatures instead of celestials, fiends and undead.

#### Divine Blessings
You do not have access to the ***Protection from Evil*** divine blessing. You can instead use:

 ***Protection from Law***. Constructs, devils and other lawfully aligned extraplanar creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition you can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.

#### Forceful Strikes
All base paladin class features that deal radiant damage, instead deal force damage.

#### Divine Smite
You can not use Divine Smite. This feature is replaced by Chaos Strike.

</div>

### Chaos Strike
When you attack a creature with a melee weapon, you can spend Devotion to bless your strike with the powers of primordial chaos. If you miss, the Devotion is not spent. Otherwise, you deal 1d6 extra damage per Devotion spent in addition to the weapon’s damage. Constructs, devils and other lawfully aligned extraplanar creatures take an additional d6 damage.

Roll a d6 to determine the type of extra damage. A target that takes the damage must make a Constitution saving throw or also experience an additional effect based on the damage type.

|  | Type | Extra Effect |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| 1 | Acid | The target takes acid damage equal to half your paladin level at the end of its next turn.
| 2 | Cold | The target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.
| 3 | Fire | The target is blinded until the end of its next turn.
| 4 | Lightning | The target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
| 5 | Poison | The target is poisoned until the end of its next turn.
| 6 | Thunder | The target is knocked prone and 15 feet directly away from you.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, you can spend one additional die from your pool to make it a Deconstructing Smite. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

<div class="feat">

## Deconstructing Smite
If the target is a construct, and is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer with this attack, it stops functioning, i.e. becomes stunned. If it has more than 50 hp, it avoids the effect on a successful Constitution save.

It remains like this for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute, or until it receives damage, at which point it starts functioning again.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Endure Elements
    For 8 hours your targets are less affected by extreme cold or heat. The desert sun would seem merely warm to a creature protected from this spell, while freezing temperatures would seem as merely cool.

</div>

### Prayer: Primeval Speech
*Add this to your selectable prayers.*

By calling on the land's natural forces, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with a beast for 10 minutes if you can first make it stay in your proximity while performing the Prayer. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at a minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day.

During this communication you can spend 1 Devotion to force the beast to roll a Wisdom save. On a failed save you can select one of the following:

 ***Beast Sense***. For 1 hour, you can use your action to see through the beast’s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the beast’s senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

 ***Messenger***. You can use the beast to deliver a message. Specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels up to 24 hours toward the specified location.

 When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination during the 24 hours, the message is lost.

### Aura of Impunity
You and friendly creatures within 10 ft are unaffected by nonmagical difficult terrain while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.


### Strengthening the Divine at 9th level
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage.

- #### Prayer: Commune with Nature
    *Add this to your selectable prayers.*

    During your prayer, you become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. It does not work where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

    In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function
    You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:<br/>
    -- terrain and bodies of water.<br/>
    -- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or people.<br/>
    -- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead.<br/>
    -- influence from other planes of existence.<br/>
    -- buildings.

    For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

</div>

### Strengthening the Divine at 15th level
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 1 Devotion.

    ***Quick Footed***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. When you use your action to Dash or Disengage, you can make a single weapon attack as a ***bonus action***.

- #### Channel Divinity: Tree Strike
    You know the following Channel Divinity option.

    You ask the trees within 60 ft to aid you in battle. Each targeted tree grasp at enemy creatures within 10 ft of it with its branches, pulling and constricting that creature. The foes must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d8 bludgeoning damage, be pulled to the tree, and become restrained.

    At the start of each of its turns, the restrained creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your Strength of Devotion DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained.

</div>

### Limitless Power
By using your ***action*** and spending 5 Devotion, you break free of all bonds and restrictions, adopting a mantle of sovereignity. For 1 minute, you gain a flying speed of 90 ft, experience the effects of the *freedom of movement* spell, and are immune to enchantment spells you do not choose to be affected by.

You can also move through other creatures and objects, but take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.







<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-ancients">Oath of the Ancients</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Naturalist, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Speak with Animals |
| 7th | Aura of Warding |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Undying Sentinel |
| 20th | Elder Champion |

</div>

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things  - leaves, antlers or flowers - to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.

#### Tenets of the Ancients
The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

 **Kindle the Light**. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

 **Shelter the Light**. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.

 **Preserve Your Own Light**. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.

 **Be the Light**. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.


### Naturalist
You are well-versed with the wilds and their natural balms and remedies. You gain 3 skill points to spend on the *Nature*, *Survival* and *Herbalism* skills.

### Sacred Touch
When you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Ensnaring Smite.

<div class="feat">

## Ensnaring Smite
A writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw.

If the target succeeds on the save, the vines deal 1d4 piercing damage for each Devotion spent, and then shrivel away.

While restrained by the vines, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage per Devotion spent, at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or an adjacent creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your devotion DC. On a success, the target is freed.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Nature's Wrath
    You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. Spectral vines spring up and reach for ***all*** creatures of your choice within range. Each creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.

- #### Turn the Faithless
    You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words, painful for fey and fiends to hear. ***Each fey or fiend within range*** that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

</div>


### Speak with Animals
You can spend 1 Devotion to gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for 10 minutes. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM’s discretion.

### Aura of Warding
Ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 ft have resistance to damage from spells.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use one of these blessings, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage.

    ***Sentinel of Nature***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage.

- #### Prayer: Commune with Nature
    You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.

    During your prayer, you become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. It does not work where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

    In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function
    You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:<br/>
    -- terrain and bodies of water.<br/>
    -- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or people.<br/>
    -- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead.<br/>
    -- influence from other planes of existence.<br/>
    -- buildings.

    For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

</div>

### Undying Sentinel
When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.

### Elder Champion

By using your ***action*** and spending 5 Devotion, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
 - Your divine blessings only require a ***bonus action*** to use and cost 1 Devotion less.
 - Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your Paladin features.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-balance">Oath of Balance</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Skills,<br>Sacred Touch|
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Censure |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine
| 15th | Without Opinion |
| 20th | Elder Champion |

</div>

The grand struggles of cosmic forces representing good, evil, law, and chaos engulf many worlds in the multiverse. Those who take on the Oath of Balance are paladins who choose to step back from this conflict, believing alliance with any extreme only blinds one to the truths of the universe.

Instead, these warriors pursue the objectivity of what they deem "ultimate truth," believing it to lie within a perfect balance of all possible beliefs, factions, and practices. Bearers of the oath are further distinguished by the way they blend divine mysticism with arcane technique, as the Oath of Balance reverences arcana as a neutral power with no regard for passion or belief.

These paladins are most often called impartialists, knight-arcanists, or paramanders. Being merely mortal, such warriors cannot do literal battle with the very forces of cosmic ethics. However, it is common for such to target monsters they see as the physical incarnations of extremity. Dragons and giants especially earn their ire for how their disproportionate strength and violent tendencies can unduly impact the surrounding world.

> *"What is true for you, is true for you, and what is true for me, is true for me."*
>
> -- Protagoras, Ideas of the Great Philosophers


#### Tenets of balance
The Oath of Balance is sworn by servants of arcane gods, pantheons of knowledge, or secret worldly fellowships, and often hold the following four ideals above all others:

 **Uphold the Balance**. Distance yourself from all extremes and the strife inherent to such division. The world is what it is, and each player has their part.

 **Moderate Your Passion**. Intense emotion is the birthplace of the conflicts you seek to quell. As in all things, be sober and employ your mind over your heart.

 **Seek After Truth**. Of all things that are, truth is the greatest of all. Always seek a full understanding of the reality of the situation, and let no illusions stand before your impartial gaze.

 **Guide the Lost**. Though you conquer imbalance, you sow only sectarianism if you forget to aid to those without your insight. Respect those who do not understand the virtues of balance. Your companionship will turn them to your cause.


<div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

### Paladin Feature Change
Paladins of Balance are often opposed to both sides in the conflict of good and evil. The following features are changed when you take this oath:

#### Detect Intrusion
When you use your Divine Sense, you instead detects the presence of magic, which for the purposes of this feature includes extraplanar creatures, objects and portals.

#### Divine Blessings
You do not have access to the ***Protection from Evil*** divine blessing.

#### Forceful Strikes
All base paladin class features that deal radiant damage, instead deal force damage.

#### Strike Inbalance
When you use your Divine Smite, you inflict an extra 1d8 damage against celestials in addition to fiends and undead.

</div>

### Bonus Skills
When you take this oath, you gain 1 skill point each on the *Arcana* and *Cosmology* skills.

### Sacred Touch
You can use Banish with Divine Smite by spending only 1 Devotion. Used this way it only has effect if the target has 50 hit points or fewer and is a native to a different plane of existence. If not, the Devotion is lost.

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### As Above
    As a ***bonus action***, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to call down cosmic fire from the higher planes to burn your enemies. Target creatures must make a Charisma saving throw or take radiant damage equal to 10 + your paladin level, and become immersed in an ethereal light preventing them from taking the Hide action or being invisible for 1 minute.

- #### So Below
    You can use your Channel Divinity feature to summon the corrupted vigor of the lower planes to lend power to your voice. ***Each fey, celestial, and aberration*** within 30 ft must make a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshift or similar, that form is revealed while turned.

</div>

### Aura of Censure
The powers of the servants of otherworldly entities wither before your impartial gaze. Spell attacks targeting allied creatures within 10 ft of you are made with disadvantage.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessing
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Protection from the Extreme***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey and other creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For ***1 minute*** they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

- #### Channel Divinity: Magic Circle
    You learn Magic Circle in addition to your other Channel Divinity options. You can use it once per day without spending a daily use of Channel Divinity.

</div>

### Without Opinion
Your mind becomes further removed from the world and its quarrels, and your ambivalence is inscrutable. You are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, as well as any divination spell that you refuse. Checks to ascertain your intentions or sincerity are made at disadvantage.

You also gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws, and your alignment can't be changed by magic.

### Impose Compromise
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to enforce your will for dispassionate balance upon the rest of the world. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- If a creature would make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw against you at advantage, it instead makes the roll normally.
- If you would make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw disadvantage, you instead make the roll normally.
- You gain the benefits of the *true seeing* spell.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-bastion">Oath of the Bastion</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Perceptive,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Beacon of Hope |
| 15th | Everlasting Sentinel |
| 17th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 20th | Bulwark of Faith |

</div>

Swearing to defend their charge at any cost, paladins who take the Oath of the Bastion make it their duty to protect a sacred location, a holy relic, or a group of people. Some paladins spend the entirety of their lifetime defending a single charge until they grow too old to maintain their watch and must pass their position off to a squire or apprentice. Others change protectorates, and after ensuring the safety of one charge they find another. These latter paladins are sometimes known as servitor knights, continually striving to aid others in a quest and going where they are needed at that moment.

Defending others is a second nature to paladins of this oath, and they will often defend those in need, even if they are not formally their protectorate.

#### Tenets of the Bastion
Each paladin has their own tenets of the Oath of the Bastion, usually passed down from a master knight to their apprentice. While the exact wordings of each oath vary, all share similar principles.

 **Be the Shield**. Guard your protectorate, for it matters more than your own life.

 **Be the Fortress**. Never surrender or abandon your charge, even if it means your death.

 **Be the Rock**. Never retreat unless doing so saves your charge, for it matters more than personal pride or honour.

 **Be the Wall**. Help others and protect them from harm, especially those unable to protect themselves.

### Perceptive
When you take this oath at 1st level, you are always alert and on the lookout for danger in your surroundings as well as sinister motives in people you meet. You gain 1 skill point to spend on *Perception*.

### Sacred Touch
You can spend 1 Devotion as a ***reaction*** when taking damage, to reduce damage you take by 2d8.

In addition you gain access to the following divine blessing, which you can only use on yourself:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Sacred Armor***. You focus divine power into your shield or your armor. For ***1 minute*** you add half your Charisma modifier (round up) to your AC and are immune to critical hits. Your armor or shield also emits bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light for 20 ft beyond that. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, or are no longer wearing this armor or holding the shield this effect ends.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
If you know Compelled Duel, then whenever you use it, you can simultaneously use a blessing on yourself as if you had spent 1 Devotion.

In addition you learn the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Might
    With a quick prayer, you augment the skills and strength of your targets. Each target gains a Divine Might die. This die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 1 minute has passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

- #### Sacred Ward
    Targets are warded against attack. For 1 minute, any creature who targets a warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

    If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this effect ends.

</div>

### Beacon of Hope
Creatures within your Aura of Protection have advantage on death saving throws and on rolls made to regain hit points.

### Everlasting Sentinel
When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to automatically stabilize. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

In addition, you age at a slower rate. Your body ages only a single year for every decade of life, and you are immune to being magically aged.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Cleansing Touch
    Your Cleansing Touch feature can now be used to reduce a target’s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:<br/>
    -- One effect that charmed or petrified the target.<br/>
    -- Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores.<br/>
    -- One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum.

- #### Wall of Force
    You can use 5 Devotion to cast the *wall of force* spell.

</div>

### Bulwark of Faith
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to suffuse your form with divine energy, making your flesh as hardy as stone and your bones are unyielding as iron. For 10 minutes, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to all damage except psychic damage
- You cannot be moved by other creatures unless you choose to be moved.
- You automatically succeed on saving throws to maintain your concentration on paladin effects provided the DC is 19 or less.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-benevolence">Oath of Benevolence</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Kind Demeanor,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Benevolence |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Tireless Spirit |
| 20th | Inner Majesty

</div>

A true Oath of Benevolence is rare in the world, for it is both the humblest and noblest of sacred vows. Sworn only by those at their lowest — whether from birth or through reversal of fortune — it is a determination by the paladin to give to others that goodness which has been refused to them. These paladins may starve nigh to death, yet give their last piece of bread to the beggar; may weep from vulgar treatment, yet give polite word and kind remark; may long for all that is lost from their life, yet give everything to soothe another in pain.

Called Lightbearers and Dream Knights, bearers of the Oath of Benevolence find comfort in hope and purpose in love, acting as friends to all living things: outcast, royal, beast, and mortal alike. Many are storytellers, using fairytale and make-believe as a way to escape sorrowful reality, if but for a moment. For these, choosing to take up arms often comes after seeing the painful aftermath of wicked brutality, moving them to become champions of the underserved and forgotten. Whether they struggle to live or simply once did, all such paladins move among the downtrodden as one among equals and friends, an ally to soothe the pains they know so well.

#### Tenets of Benevolence
To swear the Oath of Benevolence, a paladin consciously chooses to follow its tenets in spite of — or even because of — those hardships they have experienced.

 **Kindness**. Everyone deserves a good turn and tender regard. Keep a prayer in your heart even for the wicked.

 **Grace**. Be stronger than the pain that surrounds you. A soft answer may not turn away wrath, but it is strength to you and inspiration to friends. You can't be torn or broken.

 **Dignity**. Love of others includes respect for self. Always be certain of your own worth and value as a person.

 **Hope**. The worst never really comes. Even if it does, believe and persevere. This shall pass, and you shall live.

### Kind Demeanor
You are a beacon of inspiration to those around you. You have proficiency on Charisma checks made while talking to non-evil humanoids, as long as you follow your tenets.

### Sacred Touch
Whenever you use you Lay on Hands to heal another creature that is below half its maximum hit points (before the healing), it is also protected by a Sacred Ward.

<div class="feat">

## Sacred Ward
Target is warded against attacks. For 1 minute, any creature who targets a warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this effect ends.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### A Moment’s Rest
    You can use your Channel Divinity over the course of ***1 minute*** to provide comfort and respite to those around you through kind ministration and uplifting words or stories. Each conscious creature of your choice within 30 ft can regain hit points by spending one hit die, and a creature that does so gains temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points it regains.

- #### Courageous Words
    You can call out to your allies and give them the courage to succeed. Each target gains a Courage die. A Courage die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 10 minutes have passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

</div>

### Aura of Benevolence
You and your companions are able to find hope in solidarity to overcome even the darkest trials. While you or at least one friendly creature within 10 ft of you is conscious, you and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you automatically succeed on their death saving throws.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Sentinel of Hope***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage.

- #### Cleansing Touch
    Your Cleansing Touch feature can now be used to reduce a target’s exhaustion level by one, or one of the following effects on the target:<br/>
    -- End one effect that charms or petrifies a target.<br/>
    -- Increase a reduction to one of the target’s ability scores with 1.<br/>
    -- End one effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum.

</div>

### Tireless Spirit
You can persevere beyond mortal limits. You're immune to the effects of exhaustion, except death. Magic can't force you to sleep or reduce your movement speed.

### Inner Majesty
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to manifest visibly the regal spirit you've always borne within, adopting a mantle of benevolence and brilliant radiance. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - You shed bright light for 15 ft and dim light 15 ft beyond that. This light is sunlight.
 - When you use your Divine Smite feature, you deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target.
 - You emanate an aura of majesty in a 30 ft radius. When a hostile creature starts its turn in the aura or enters it for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Strength of Devotion DC or gain the charmed condition until the start of its next turn or until you do anything harmful to it.

Alternatively, you can cast the *heroes' feast* spell once without requiring a spell slot or any material components.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-conquest">Oath of Conquest</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Overlord, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Conquest |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine, Terror
| 15th | Domination |
| 20th | Invincible Conqueror |

</div>

The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn’t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.

Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins—called hell knights—as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.

#### Tenets of Conquest
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm. A hell knight’s oath appears in Infernal runes, a brutal reminder of vows to the Lords of Hell.

  **Douse the Flame of Hope.** It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies’ will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.

  **Rule with an Iron Fist.** Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.

  **Strength Above All.** You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.

### Overlord
When you take this oath at 1st level, your commanding presence brings others to heel. You gain you gain the *Physique - Intimidate* skill. If you have that skill already, you may spend a skill point on any other class skill.


### Sacred Touch
When you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Vengeful Smite.

<div class="feat">

## Vengeful Smite
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.

If the target succeeds on a save against this blessing, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each Devotion you spent.

</div>

In addition, you gain access to the following blessing:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Subjugate the Cowards***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. Whenever an intimidated or frightened creature hits you with a melee attack, it takes 5 necrotic damage.
</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Commanding Presence
    You can use your Channel Divinity to forcefully speak a one-word command. Targets that fail a Wisdom saving throw must follow the command on their next turn. This has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

- #### Conquering Presence
  You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. Each target that fails a Wisdom saving throw becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

</div>

### Aura of Conquest
You constantly emanate a menacing aura while you’re not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 ft from you in every direction, but not through total cover. If a creature is frightened of you, it takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Channel Divinity: Hold Person
    *Add this to your Channel Divinity options.*

    Target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target.

- #### Domination
    You can spend 4 Devotion to cast the spell *dominate beast* at its lowest level.
</div>

### Terror
Whenever a creature is frightened by one of your Paladin features, you can choose it to additionally experience terror.

<div class="feat">

## Terror
While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.

If the effect causing the creature to be frightened allows a new save at the end of its turns, it only gets to roll the save if it ends its turn in a location where it does not see you.
</div>

### Domination
You can spend 5 Devotion to cast the spell *dominate person* at its lowest level.

### Invincible Conqueror
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to harness your extraordinary martial prowess, becoming an avatar of conquest. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - You have resistance to all damage.
 - When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
 - Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

| 7th | Aura of Courage |

| 15th | Protecting Touch |
| 20th | Fearless Champion |

</div>

The Oath of Courage is an oath seldom taken, for it elevates a devoted woman or man above just the station of being a paladin. They become an ideal; a clarion call in the darkness capable of bolstering those who are frightened. To swear this oath is to make yourself an enemy of all who would use terror to manipulate and harm the frightened. Just as you can sense evil and undeath, undeath and evil can sense you.

The armor and appearance of these paladins is often simple and utilitarian; whatever gets the job done. What’s different about them is their voice: strong, compassionate, and inspiring. It is the voice of a leader in the darkest of times.

#### Tenets of Courage
The Oath of Courage has few tenets, but they serve as constant reminders about a paladin’s purpose. Often, paladins will repeat these tenets to themselves in a crisis to strengthen their resolve.

 **Fight the Fear**. Fear exists for only one purpose: to be conquered. You must fight the fear in your own heart before you can fight the fear in others.

 **Bolster the Timid**. Agents of fear—undead and otherworldly horrors—will try to break your compatriots will with terror. Do not let them. Your courageous example will make your allies courageous as well.

 **Inspire the Meek**. You have taken this oath, but the common person hasn’t. They will be afraid when monsters come to their door. It is your duty to give them the hope, the confidence, and the tools to fight alongside you.

### Leader
When you take this oath at 1st level, you are a beacon of inspiration to those around you. You gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Leadership* skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Lay on Hands feature, you remove any fear effect on the target, as well as granting it temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

In addition, you gain access to the following blessing:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Bolster Mental Fortitude***. You gain advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Courageous Words
    You can call out to your allies and give them the courage to succeed. Each target gains a Courage die. A Courage die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 10 minutes have passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

- ### Prayer: A Moment's Rest
    You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.

    During a short rest you provide comfort and respite to those around you through kind prayer and uplifting words. Each conscious creature of your choice can spend one additional hit die, and a creature that does so gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

</div>

### Aura of Courage
You emanate an Aura of Courage earlier than other paladins. At 10th level its range is improved to 30 ft, and further improves to 60 ft at 18th level.

### Channel Divinity: Magic Circle
You learn Magic Circle in addition to your other Channel Divinity options. You can use it once per day without spending a daily use of Channel Divinity.

### Protecting Touch
Your Lay on Hands feature is improved in order to not only heal, but also protect your allies on the battlefield. When you use Lay on Hands on a creature, that creature gains a +2 bonus to AC for 1 hour, provided they continue to fight courageously.

Any attempt to move away from, flee from, or hide from an enemy in combat negates bonus. A creature cannot receive this bonus to AC more than once within the hour.

### Fearless Champion
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to assume the form of a holy avatar of courage. You have the ability to wrest the fear from those around you and inspire them towards greatness. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - Your features become like that of a lion. You gain a Roar attack that, as an ***action***, deals 3d6 thunder damage to all Evil creatures within 30 ft that can hear you.
 - All allies that can see or hear you are immune to being frightened or charmed.
 - All allies within 15 ft have advantage on attack rolls against undead and fiends, and advantage on saving throws to resist effects and spells by undead and fiends.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-crown">Oath of the Crown</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bond of Service, Guardsman |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Allegiance |
| 13th | Guardians of the Crown |
| 15th | Unyielding Spirit |
| 20th | Exalted Champion |

</div>

The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.

#### Tenets of the Crown
The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.
 **Law**. The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.

 **Loyalty**. Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.

 **Courage**. You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?

 **Resposibility**. You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

### Bond of Service
When you use a divine blessing on yourself, you can also affect one other adjacent creature without spending additional Devotion, if it has also sworn allegiance to your liege.

While affected by one of your blessings this way, and within 60 ft of you, it has resistance to all damage. However, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

In addition to the normal ways a blessing can end, cast this way it also ends if you and the target become separated by more than 60 ft, or if you use Bond of Service on another target. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

### Guardsman
When you take this oath, you learn to root out disorder and threats against your liege. You gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Investigation* skill.

### Channel Divinity
If you know Compelled Duel you can use it once per day without spending a daily use of Channel Divinity.

In addition you learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Commanding Presence
    You can use your Channel Divinity to forcefully speak a one-word command. Targets that fail a Wisdom saving throw must follow the command on their next turn. This has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

- #### Turn the Tide
    As a ***bonus action***, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 ft of you regains hit points equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifier if it has less than half of its hit points.

</div>

### Aura of Allegiance
You can shield others from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 ft takes damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to halve the damage against that target. You then take the same amount of damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

Starting at 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Guardians of the Crown
You can spend 4 Devotion to summon spirits of warriors who have fallen in the defense of your liege. Their spectral forms flit around you to a distance of 15 ft. The first time each round a creature in the area makes an attack against you or your allies, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage is radiant or necrotic; make the choice when you gain this feature. When 10 minutes have past, or the guardian spirits have dealt 60 or more damage, they disappear.

### Unyielding Spirit
You have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.

### Exalted Champion
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to make your presence on the field of battle an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You gain the following benefits for 1 hour:

 - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
 - Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 ft of you.
 - You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 ft of you.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-devotion">Oath of Devotion</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Disciple,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Beacon of Hope |
| 15th | Purity of Spirit |
| 17th | Prayer: Commune |
| 20th | Holy Nimbus |

</div>

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels - the perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

#### Tenets of Devotion
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
 **Honesty**. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

 **Courage**. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

 **Compassion**. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

 **Honor**. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

 **Duty**. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

### Disciple
When you take this oath, you have advanced well in your spiritual training. You gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Religion* skill.

### Sacred Touch
Whenever you use a divine blessing on only yourself, you can choose to make your weapon emit bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light 20 ft beyond that. You can end this effect as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding this weapon, lose concentration or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

In addition you gain access to the following divine blessing, which you can only use on yourself:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Sacred Armor***. You focus divine power into your shield or your armor. For ***1 minute*** you add half your Charisma modifier (round up) to your AC and are immune to critical hits. Your armor or shield also emits bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light for 20 ft beyond that. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, or are no longer wearing this armor or holding the shield this effect ends.
</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Sacred Ward
    Targets are warded against attack. For 1 minute, any creature who targets a warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

    If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this effect ends.

- #### Turn the Unholy
    As an ***action***, you speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. **Each fiend or undead** that can see or hear you within 30 ft must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

</div>

### Beacon of Hope
Creatures within your Aura of Protection have advantage on death saving throws and on rolls made to regain hit points.

### Purity of Spirit
You are always under the effects of your *protection from evil* divine blessing.

### Prayer: Commune
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the prayer ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren’t omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you use this prayer two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each use after the first that you get no answer.

### Holy Nimbus
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30 ft radius, and dim light shines 30 ft beyond that. While the aura lasts, you gain the following benefits:

 - You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.
 - You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and magical effects of fiends and undead.
 - Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

Keepers encounter the Elder Sign in a multitude of ways. Some find it in the derelict pages of an antediluvian tome, yet others see its shape in their very dreams. All who gaze upon it know its authority, as instinctively as animals know to fear fire; it is an icon of power originating from beyond the veil of reality, one that no men were meant to know.

You have sworn to hold the sign as its Keeper, and vowed to protect the mortal realm from the forces beyond, or vowed to tear reality asunder, and let the Elder Evils henceforth seep through.

#### Tenets of the Elder Sign
The principles held by the Keepers of the Elder sign are as esoteric as their ancient order. Dedicated to the secrets of the universe and the keeping them mercifully hidden from the world, the Keepers are a clandestine and influential organization.

 **Keep the Sign**. The Elder Sign is a tool of immense power, and must be kept safe. You can scarcely understand the source of power contained in this mere piece of geometry, but you know it can never be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.

 **Seek Knowledge**. Whenever possible, you should seek out and acquire hidden, esoteric knowledge. You are drawn to such secrets, like the Elder Sign, and perhaps can turn them against your foes.

 **Go Unseen**. It is imperative the struggles you face are kept secret. The forces are work here are barely comprehensible, and their reveal can drive men to the brink of madness.

 **Defend the Gates**. It is your job to stand vanguard at the gates that form where our world intersects the Far Realm. You may be protecting it from those who would seek to close it, or you may wish to stem the tide of creatures coming through.

<div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

### Paladin Feature Change
Paladins of the Elder Sign are more focuse on fighting Elder Evils. The following features are changed when you take this oath:

#### Detect Intrusion
When you use your Divine Sense, you instead detects the presence of magic, which for the purposes of this feature includes extraplanar creatures, objects and portals.

#### Forceful Strikes
All base paladin class features that deal radiant damage, instead deal force damage.
</div>

### Arcanist
When you take this oath, add *Arcana* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on this skill.

### Sacred Touch
You can use Banish with Divine Smite by spending only 1 Devotion. Used this way it only has effect if the target has 50 hit points or fewer and is a native to a different plane of existence. If not, the Devotion is lost.

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Call For Battle
    Select one of your Divine blessings. Each target is affected as if you had used that blessing and spent 1 Devotion. In addition to other end conditions, this blessing also ends if there are no aberrations or extraplanar creatures present.

- #### Invoke the Elder Sign
    As an ***action***, you can fleetingly create the form of the Elder Sign, a powerful symbol which can strengthen or wear thin the walls of reality. Choose an adjacent space, which is where the sign burns brightly for 1 minute in a 20 ft radius sphere. No darkness, magical or otherwise, can obscure this area. Each creature friendly to you in this area gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and gains a +1 bonus to AC.

    No aberration or extraplanar creature can enter or teleport within this area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. As such, Elder Signs are often placed in front of gates to the Far Realm, to close leaks into that reality.

</div>

### Aura of Mental Fortitude
You and allies within 10 ft of you have resistance to psychic damage.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Channel Divinity: Detect Thoughts
    *You know this Channel Divinity option in addition to your other options.*

    You can detect the presence, and read the surface thoughts of thinking creatures. When you channel as an ***action***, you sense the presence of all creatures within 30 ft with an Intelligence of 4 or higher, that speak a language. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

    You can select to focus your mind on a number of creatures you detect equal to you proficiency bonus, to attempt to learn their surface thoughts, i.e. what is most on its mind in that moment. This is usually enough to determine if the creatures are alien or under the control of an aberration. The targets can make a Wisdom saving throw to prevent it. Either way, the targets knows that you are probing into their mind.

- #### Prayer: Locate Aberration
    *You learn this Prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

    During your prayer you focus on an specific aberration, or type of aberrations that you know is in the area. You sense the direction to its location, as long as it is within 1,000 ft of you. If the target is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

</div>

### Word of Revelation
BYour research in musty, forbidden tomes has proven fruitful. As an ***action***, you can utter a word used in the creation of the universe. All magic effects within 15 ft of you are targeted by *dispel magic*. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Sunder Reality
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to call upon the Elder Sign to tear the very fabric of reality, creating a one-way rift to or from the Far Realm for 1 minute. You create 5-ft radius sphere in an unoccupied space that you can see and decide whether this portal should lead to, or come from the Far Realm. Creatures that end their turn within 30 ft of the sphere are inexplicably moved 5 ft toward it, as if pulled by an unseen force.


If the portal leads to the Far Realm, creatures that enter it are flung to the far reaches of space, taking 8d10 psychic damage from the horrors they witness and are ejected from the far side of the portal 1 round later.

If the portal leads from the Far Realm, creatures adjacent to it are restrained by tentacles, claws, or other monstrous appendages that reach through it. Creatures so restrained can break free as an action by making a Strength saving throw.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-freshness">Oath of Freshness</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Charming Demeanor,<br/>Sacred Touch,<br/>Shield of Stardom |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 5th | High Note |
| 7th | Aura of Freshness |
| 15th | Sick Beats |
| 17th | Prayer: Beseech Muse |
| 20th | Calamari Inkantation |

</div>

Being in style isn't just a fashion statement—it's a way of life! By taking on the Oath of Freshness, you have vowed to not only look your best, but to moreover always be your best. By so doing, you become a paragon of fun and laughter, the star of every show. With color and music as your primary tools and a good weapon to keep your rhythm, you're sure to light up the world around you and make it look as good as you feel inside. Smile for the crowd, superstar! The spotlight's on you!

#### Tenets of Freshness
These paladins have sworn their oaths to deities of music and beauty, emphasizing that people should be happy and not take life too seriously.

 **Stay Fresh**. A good look is a good feeling, so always stay on top of what's new, what's cool, and make sure you are too.

 **Be Fresh**. But a good look is nothing without a good heart, so live to the fullest! Be happy and make others happy too.

 **No Worries**. There's more to life than troubles and cares. Remember to take time to relax and focus on what's fun.

 **No Regrets**. Sometimes people mess up. Sometimes that's you! But mistakes are of the past, and you live for the future. Leave flaws and fights behind to make the most of now.

#### Fresh Looks
Being fresh inside and out takes a lot of effort! As a paladin bearing the Oath of Freshness, you've likely put in considerable time to cultivate a maximally fresh look that will keep you in style all season long. The following table includes some suggestions for what clothing or tylings that look might entail, and you can also use it as inspiration to create your own fresh look.


| Roll | Fresh Look |
|:----:|:-----------|
| 1 | White hats with big black bows are so in this year.
| 2 | Yellow is a warm, inviting color, so you've adorned all your armor and clothing with ribbons and flowers.
| 3 | Big, black, funky boots. You'll wear them through the Nine Hells and through high water.
| 4 | If makeup didn't exist in this world before, you've invented it.
| 5 | A polished, white crown is perfect for projecting your sense of royal confidence.
| 6 | You've dyed your hair a vibrant black and keep it nice and long—all the better to style and restyle daily!

### Charming Demeanor
You are born to be in the center. When you take this oath, gain 1 skill point each to spend on *Art* and *Speechcraft*.

### Sacred Touch
Utilizing the power of music, you can sing a short song, allowing you to use your Lay in Hands feature to a distance of 30 ft.

In addition, when you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Splat!.

<div class="feat">

## Splat!
Your strike creates an explosion of color. Each creature within 5 ft of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
</div>

### Shield of Stardom
Paladins that swear the Oath of Freshness often decide to eschew traditional armor, instead relying on pure charm and agile performance for protection. While wearing no armor, your AC equals 12 + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Courageous Words
    You can call out to your allies and give them the courage to succeed. Each target gains a Courage die. A Courage die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 10 minutes have passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

- #### Showstopper
    If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can use your Channel Divinity to attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by dance, recitation, or song. At the end of the performance, you can target humanoids or beasts within 60 ft of you who watched and listened to all of it. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, and it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it.

    This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. A target has no hint that you tried to     charm it.

</div>

### High Note
You can use 2 or more Devotion when singinging to reach a high shattering note. Each creature within 10-30 ft from you (your choice) must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 thunder damage plus an additional d8 per Devotion spent, or half that on a successful save.

A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the area.

### Aura of Freshness
Your ability to move can't be beat. Opportunity attacks against you and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you are made at disadvantage while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Sick Beats
By this level, you're practically made of music. You are immune to the deafened condition and have resistance against thunder damage. You also have advantage on ability checks to notice, listen to, and identify all music.

### Prayer: Beseech Muse
*You learn this Prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

You seek after the inspiration of a great figure of art and creation, such as a celestial patron of music or an ancient craftsman of legend. Contacting this being requires all the creative energy you possess and carries the risk of damaging your will. When you perform this prayer, make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If you fail, you lose the ability to spend Devotion, and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until you finish a long rest.

On a successful save, you can ask the being up to three questions. You must ask your questions before the end of the Prayer. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "unimportant," or "unknown" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question).

### Calamari Inkantation
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to begin singing a truly heavenly song, reaching the hearts of all who hear. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- A hostile creature that can hear you and starts its turn within 30 ft of you or moves to a point within 30 ft of you for the first time on a turn must immediately expend all of its remaining movement to dance without leaving its space. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your Strength of Devotion DC at the end of each of its turns. If it fails the saving throw by five or more, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. On a success, it becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.
- No effect can make you inaudible to any creature you can see unless you allow it.
- You and friendly creatures within 30 ft of you are immune to the charmed condition.

</div>

Sometimes called black knights, or grave knights, these paladins serve as protectors of the sacred passings into the afterlife. They constantly struggle against the forces of undeath, as they see them as the most unholy abominations that blight this land. They adorn themselves with images of death and winter - skulls, ravens, or similar symbols of their patron gods.

#### Tenets of the Grave
The tenets of the Oath of the grave have been passed down for generations. This oath emphasizes the passing between the warmth of life to the everlasting cold of death, and punishes those that defile this passing with the unholy raising of undead.

 **Annihilate the Unholy**. The undead and those who foster them are unholy and wicked. Destroy them before they defile more than they have already have.

 **Preserve the Righteous**. Death should not come early to those who have led a blessed life . Preserve the righteous, so they may live on without fear.

 **Let Souls Pass On**. Every soul deserves its place in the afterlife. Prayers and burial rites must be performed for the deceased and places of burial must be treated with respect and honour.

When you take this oath, gain the *Arcana - Necromancy* skill and its prerequisite.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Turn Undead
    As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead within 30 ft that can see and hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    Starting at 5th level, if an undead fails its saving throw against this feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold:

- #### Prayer: Speak with Dead
    You grant the semblance of life and Intelligence to a corpse you pray over, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth, can't be Undead and can not have been dead for more than 10 days.

    During the time of the prayer, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the Languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.

    This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

</div>

### Soul of Demise
Your vow of death has become far more persistent. When a creature is killed by you, it cannot be raised from the dead for the next 30 days, outside of using a wish spell.

### Prayer: Hallow
Your Prayer infuses an enclosed area with holy power for a number of days equal to your proficiency bonus. The area can be a room or a building with a radius up to 60 ft. Fiends and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area.

In addition dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.

### Reaper of Winter
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to surround yourself with a deathly chill. For 1 minute, swirls of chilling wind surround you in a 30 ft radius.

In addition, whenever a creature dies within the area, you regain 20 hit points.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-guardian">Oath of the Guardian</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Sacred Shield, Vanquisher of Evil |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: A Moment's Rest |
| 7th | Aura of Protection |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Soul of the Defender |
| 20th | Angelic Protector |

</div>

The Oath of the Guardian binds a paladin to the defense of those who cannot defend themselves. Sometimes called knight protectors, pious templar's, or divine crusaders, these paladins know that there will always be a place for them at the front lines of the battle with evil. Whether it is a small village, a singular maiden or an entire city that is threatened with destruction, they hold themselves to the expectation of protecting all who do not have the means to protect themselves.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of life and war, and use their gods' tenets as their guide through the trials they face. They do not stay in any one place too long, as those in their charge are protected and the danger passes, another's are in need of defense.

#### Tenets of the Guardian
The tenets of the Oath of the Guardian vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around the protection of the weak or misjudged. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to protect the innocent from evil or injustice, using their own sensibilities to differentiate between someone who needs their assistance, and someone who might manipulate others for their own ends.

 **Valor**. Always be prepared to stand before evil or injustice to save a life, even in the face of impossible odds.

 **Discernment**. Your ability to defend the weak is wasted on those who feign helplessness. Always know the truth of your charges need.

 **Resolve**. Always continue on in the face of adversity, persevere when others fall short, and be prepared to end a threat permanently to ensure lasting protection of those in your charge.

 **Character**. Your words and your deeds should engender trust, dependability and hope to all those you encounter. You do not know who will be the next to need your protection and your name should be beyond reproach, so as to be the first called upon when destruction is foreshadowed.

### Sacred Shield
As a ***reaction*** when a creature within 30 ft (including you) is hit by an attack, you can spend 1 Devotion to add +5 to its AC against that attack. You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result. If the attack still hits, the target gains temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier after the attack is resolved.

### Vanquisher of Evil
When you take this oath at 1st level, as long as you uphold your tenets you have advantage on Charisma ability checks against non-evil intelligent creatures, with the exception of Intimidation checks.

Additionally you have advantage on Intimidation checks against evil creatures.

### Channel Divinity
If you know Compelled Duel, then whenever you use it, you can simultaneously use a blessing on yourself as if you had spent 1 Devotion.

In addition you learn the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Ward
    As a ***bonus action*** you can protect your allies from harm. As long as you concentrate, and the target allies are within 10 ft of you, they have resistance to all damage. However, each time they take damage, you take the same amount of damage, and whatever conditions would have affected the allies affect you instead. You make any saving throws as normal.
</div>

### Prayer: A Moment's Rest
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

During a short rest you provide comfort and respite to those around you through kind prayer and uplifting words. Each conscious creature of your choice can spend one additional hit die, and a creature that does so gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

### Aura of Protection
Your divine power protects you and friendly creatures from harm. As a ***reaction*** you can reduce any damage taken to yourself or an creatures within 10 ft by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. If multiple target are damaged at the same time, this effect can target all instances of damage simultaneously.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following **Divine Blessings**, which you can use only on yourself. The cost for them is 2 Devotion.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Aura of Safety***. For 1 minute you radiate a 10 ft radius aura that protects friendly creatures. Any creature that targets one of your allies within the aura with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. If an ally in the aura makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this effect ends for that ally.

- ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning ***or*** thunder damage.

- ***Sentinel***. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage.

</div>

### Soul of the Defender
When you are reduced to below half your hit points, you can choose to begin healing yourself of damage. Using a ***bonus action***, you begin healing hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Constitution modifier every round for 1 minute. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Angelic Protector
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to become impenetrable bulwark of divine energy. For one minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - Your skin hardens and changes into a platinum sheen, your eyes turn gold, and all damage you take from any source is reduced by 5 + your Charisma modifier. This ability does not stack with your Aura of Protection.
 - You emanate an aura of compulsion in a 30 ft radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or direct all of its attacks against you.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-leadership">Oath of Leadership</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Leader, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: A Moment's Rest |
| 7th | Aura of Valor |
| 13th | Defiance |
| 15th | Lead the Charge |
| 20th | Paragon of Perfection |

</div>

The Oath of Leadership calls to paladins who seek to be the first one to raise their weapon in the face of danger and destruction. These paladins fearlessly lead the charge into battle, even if death seems unavoidable. Those sworn to this oath aim to be a guiding beacon to those without light, and apply a strong hand to those more reluctant to follow their path.

Some of them drape themselves in imposing robes and shining armor, not out of vain, but to be a symbol of hope to look up to. Others may prefer more modest clothing, as they want their actions to speak loudest of all.

#### Tenets of Conquest
The tenets of the Oath of Leadership are meant to guide a paladin in their role as a leader.

 **Show No Fear**. While others cower and run, you must remain fearless in the face of death.

 **Lead by Example**. Strife for perfection, as you are the ideal your followers look up to.

 **Guide the Misguided**. Those who stray from the path of righteousness must be brought back on its tracks.

 **Stand Against the Darkness**. Be the first to raise your weapon in times no one else will.

### Leader
When you take this oath, you become a beacon of inspiration to those around you. You gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Leadership* skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, you can spend one additional die from your pool to inspire your allies, granting each ally that can see and hear you advantage on the first attack they make before the start of your next turn. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

### Channel Divinity
If you know Compelled Duel, then whenever you use it, you can simultaneously use a blessing on yourself as if you had spent 1 Devotion.

In addition you learn the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Might
    With a quick prayer, you augment the skills and strength of your targets. Each target gains a Divine Might die. This die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 1 minute has passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

- #### Regroup
    Each allied creature within 60 ft that can see and hear you, may immediately make a move as a reaction.

</div>

### Prayer: A Moment's Rest
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

During a short rest you provide comfort and respite to those around you through kind prayer and uplifting words. Each conscious creature of your choice can spend one additional hit die, and a creature that does so gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

### Aura of Valor
You and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Defiance
When an ally is threatened, a prayer and a gesture grant the target the defiant heart to endure. You can spend 3 or more Devotion as a reaction whenever an ally takes damage from a creature. The ally reduces damage taken by 20, and can reroll any saving throw against effects that may have been caused by the attack.

The damage prevented increases by 5 for each Devotion you spend above 3.

### Lead the Charge
You are proficient with initiative. On your first turn each combat, your walking speed is doubled and you don’t provoke opportunity attacks. On that turn you can use your ***bonus action*** to beckon your allies to follow you into the fray. Choose a number of friendly creatures you can see, up to a number equal your Charisma modifier. Each of them can immediately use it’s reaction to move up to double its speed towards you, without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Paragon of Perfection
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to turn into a divine symbol of leadership. For 10 minutes, you gain the follow benefits:

 - You gain proficiency with every skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using a skill you’re proficient with.
 - Once per turn, when you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can give yourself advantage on that roll.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-lyan">Oath of the Lyan</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Lawful, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: Blessed Settlement |
| 7th | Aura of Clarity |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Lawman's Vigor |
| 20th | Pillar of Society |

</div>

Deriving its name from the ascending floors of the infinite planar tower known as Arbiter's Edifice, the Lyan is a holy paladin pledged to serve the gods of law and order. Lyans are sworn to uphold lawfulness in all senses and believe in the value of deference, honor, and trustworthiness, with little interest in matters of good and evil. Such paladins are champions of both civil and religious laws in their jurisdictions and will defend legitimate rule and governance. However, Lyans also preserve law in the abstract, being proponents of social traditions and defending such praxis as symbols of law.

For the Lyan, order is the correct state of all things. The Lyan argues that without rules, society crumbles and all life becomes nasty, brutish, and short; without the city or town, existence is uncomfortable and stagnates. Thus, chaos is more than distasteful - it is an existential threat.

Lyan paladins are loyal and duteous, with an unyielding focus on their obligations to their organizations and to smiting chaos. As such, they tend to be severe, even taciturn, in their disposition, but they are no less unfailing in their dedication to hunting and striking down the forces of chaos wherever they stand. Being unconcerned with good and evil, a Lyan is often brutal in their conduct, working within what is lawful to destroy what is not.

> *"Rules and responsibilities: These are the ties that bind us. We do what we do, because of who we are. If we did otherwise, we would not be ourselves. I will do what I have to do. And I will do what I must."*
>
> -- Neil Gaiman, The Sandman: Book of Dreams

#### Tenets of the Lyan
The creed of a Lyan varies between each organization, but all must be harmonious with the principles of the gods in upholding law and order. In practice, a Lyan can be roughly said to live according to the following tenets.

 **Order**. Be true to Law, and yield to legitimate authority, save it be a threat to order in itself. Strike down chaos where it stands. Act with consistency, and be disciplined in your conduct.

 **Decorum**. Remember the structure and laws of polity. Be courteous, but serious and professional in your manner. Defer to authority and respect subordinates as appropriate to your respective stations. Do not be over-friendly or fond.

 **Civilization**. Respect and honor the town, the barony, the kingdom, the empire. These institutions form the foundation of and are the hope for all meaningful life.

 **Responsibility**. Do not be disorderly in your own conduct. Fulfill your obligations and live up to your word. Perform your duties to the highest letter of the law, and abide by the code of your organization.

 **Allegiance**. Your first pledge is to Law. Your second is to the gods, your third to your organizatin. You should have no other allegiances. Consider the whole before the self.

<div class="block classTable frame" markdown="1">

### Paladin Feature Change
The Lyan's struggle is in behalf of law against chaos, and thus may often be unconcerned, even flippant, with the conflicts of good and evil. The following features are changed when you take this oath:

#### Detect Chaos
When you use your Divine Sense, you detect the presence of aberrations, demons and fey instead of celestials, fiends, and undead.

#### Divine Blessings
You do not have access to the ***Protection from Evil*** divine blessing. You can instead use:

 ***Protection from Chaos***. Aberrations, demons, fey and other chaoticly aligned extraplanar creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition you can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.

#### Smite the Chaotic
The bite of your blows is focused not on the unholy, but on the lawless. When you use your Divine Smite, you inflict an extra 1d8 radiant damage against  instead of fiends, and undead.

</div>

### Lawful
When you take this oath, add *Lae* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on this skill. This includes not only the mundane laws of the area you start in, but also the divine Law of Order. Additionally you have proficiency on Intelligence checks regarding the enemies of Law, namely aberrations, demons and fey.

### Sacred Touch
You can use the Banish option by spending only 1 Devotion. Used this way it only has effect if the target has 50 hit points or fewer and is a native to a different plane of existence. If not, the Devotion is lost.

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Halting Presence
    You can use your Channel Divinity to forcefully shout a command for enemies to halt. Targets that fail a Wisdom saving throw cannot make any actions, except reactions. This lasts until you do not use an action to hold the spell or lose concentration. In addition, targets can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns, to end the effect on themself only.

    This has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

- #### Turn the Unlawful
    As an ***action***, you can utter a prayer that is painful to creatures of chaos. You display your holy weapon and speak your condemnatory prayer, using Channel Divinity. Each aberration, demon, or fey that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

</div>

### Prayer: Blessed Settlement
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

Your prayer sanctifies a 15 ft radius area against the chaos and encroachment of wilderness. The edge of the area is visibly marked by a faintly glowing silver-colored line. You are magically made aware if any hostile creature enters the area, but do not know where they are or how many there are. If you are sleeping at the time, you are magically awoken. This effect lasts for 8 hours or until you leave the blessed radius.

### Aura of Clarity
Your presence dispels confusion and disarray. While you are conscious, you and friendly creatures within 10 ft cannot be charmed or affected by confusion.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessing
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage.

- #### Prayer: Commune with Civilization
    *You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

    You briefly become one with the order of civilization and gain knowledge of surrounding settlements within 3 miles. You instantly gain knowledge of the following facts about each settlement:<br/>
    -- Road layouts and landmarks between you and the settlement.<br/>
    -- If powerful extraplanar creatures, fey or undead exist within the settlement.<br/>
    -- Influence from other planes of existence.<br/>
    -- Building types of your choice. For example, you could determine the fastest route to a city center, the popular local foods, and the location of any blacksmiths in the area.<br/>
    -- Prevalent goods, services or factions.<br/>
    -- An intuitive knowledge of the customs, laws, mores and social etiquette followed within. This only grants knowledge that would be known by most inhabitans of the settlement.

</div>

### Lawman's Vigor
The divine essence of your magics can shore up your own frame. Whenever you use Devotion, you gain temporary hit points equal to your paladin level.

Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with people involved in government and law, such as judges, constabulary, royalty, or bureaucrats.

### Pillar of Society
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to become an inspiring avatar of cosmic law, whose steps claim the earth for civilization. For 1 minute, your body looks as if it burns with a holy fire, and you gain the following benefits:

- Whenever you or a friendly creature within 30 ft hits with an attack, the attack inflicts an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
- Each hostile creature within 30 ft must subtract 1d6 from any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects from aberrations, demons and fey.

</div>

The Oath of Martyrdom is perhaps the most selfless of all oaths: to protect and serve, to the death if necessary. They are almost universally known as martyrs, though some also call them sacred defenders, hospitalers or comforters. A paladin swearing an Oath of Martyrdom is not a death-seeker; quite the contrary, it holds life at the highest value, to the extent of being willing to sacrifice something so priceless for something of even greater worth. Their adornments reflect their choice in life: red and purple colors representing blood and penitence (respectively), and sometimes the relic of another holy martyr to remind the paladin of its Oath.

#### Tenets of Martyrdom
The tenets of this Oath involve, at their core, understanding and being a witness to said understanding; the importance of understanding the true value of sacrifice, why endure pain and suffering for the sake of others, and the importance of life. Paladins upholding these tenets must be willing to give even their lives for the good-will of others, so all of them are universally good: few, if any, are neutral. The essential principles of the Oath are as such:

 **Life is Sacred and Invaluable**. I will not take the life of another if I can help it; if I must do so, I will respect it to the very end.

 **End the Suffering of Others**. Pain and suffering are enemies of the sanctity of life. I must do all that I can to end pain and suffering, to the extent that I can.

 **Ease the Suffering of Others**. If I cannot end the suffering no matter what I try, I will partake willingly of their suffering to bear witness of a better tomorrow.

 **Death is the Ultimate Sacrifice**. If I must give my sacred, priceless life, it shall be for something greater. I will not give my life for any less.

### Spare the Dying
When you take this oath, you can prevent others from dying with a simple touch. As an ***action*** you can touch a living creature that has 0 hit points to stabilize it.

### Sacred Touch
Your touch bolsters your allies. When you use the Lay on Hands feature, you also grant the target temporary hit points equal to your level.

In addition you can use Lay on Hands on yourself as a ***bonus action***.

### Channel Divinity
If you know Compelled Duel, then whenever you use it, you can simultaneously use a blessing on yourself as if you had spent 1 Devotion.

In addition you learn the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Ward
    As a ***bonus action*** you can protect your allies from harm. As long as you concentrate, and the target allies are within 10 ft of you, they have resistance to all damage. However, each time they take damage, you take the same amount of damage, and whatever conditions would have affected the allies affect you instead. You make any saving throws as normal.

- #### Stigmata
    You can heal the wounds of allies by partaking of their pain and suffering in their stead. Each target, except yourself, heals a number of hit points equal to twice the amount of damage you choose to take. For example, you can heal each target 10 points of damage by taking 5 damage.

</div>

### Aura of Martyrdom
You can ease the pain of others around you by partaking of their wounds. Allies within 10 ft ignore an amount of hit point damage equal your Charisma modifier, but all damage ignored is taken by you.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use one of these blessings, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Blessed Martyr***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage, as well as any damage you take as result of preventing damage to allies.

- #### Prayer
    You learn the prayer Revivify in addition to your other prayers known.

- #### Soul of the Defender
    When you are reduced to below half your hit points, you can choose to begin healing yourself of damage. Using a ***bonus action***, you begin healing hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Constitution modifier at the start of each round for 1 minute. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

</div>

### Bear thy Brothers Burden
As a ***reaction*** you can choose to take a spell or effect used by an enemy against an ally within 30 ft. The spell or effect must impose some kind of affliction: a spell like *poison* or the gaze of a Medusa are valid choices, but a *fireball* spell or a dragon's breath won't. If the spell or effect targets multiple creatures, only those within 30 ft of you are not affected, whether you'd be affected or not.

If the effect allows a saving throw, you make it using your own saving throw bonuses. You are affected by the spell or effect even if you would be otherwise immune to it.

### Ultimate Sacrifice
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to enter a state where pain and wounds are pointless, as you accept death willingly. While on this state, light emerges from your eyes, as well as any wound you take. For 1 minute or until the end of the battle, you gain the following benefits:

- You remain alive and conscious even if you are at 0 hit points. Track all damage you would take after reaching 0 hp; once the effect is over, you take all this damage instantly, making death saves as usual (or die instantly from massive damage, if applicable).
- Your Aura of Martyrdom instead absorbs an amount of damage equal to five times your Charisma modifier.
- You and all allies within 30 ft gain immunity to ability damage and death effects. You also gain immunity to all spells that restore hit point damage.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-purge">Oath of the Purge</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Razing Flames |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Divine Flames |
| 20th | Burning Path |

</div>

The Oath of the Purge dictates that impurity be cleansed by fire. This impurity may take many forms, such as a cult to an Evil god, a plague of undeath, the invasion of a monstrous war band, or perhaps less overt threats, like a duke who refuses to bow to your glorious cause.

Paladins of the Purge adorn their clothes and armor with imagery of dragons and flames, to serve as both warning and promise. Their reputations as purgers, red knights, and flame-lords proceed them wherever they travel.

#### Tenets of the Purge
Though the nature of any particular Purge varies by incident, the tenets serve as self-perpetuating, self-enforcing guidelines to annihilate the foe. Paladins who uphold these tenets are often paranoid and reactionary.

 **Scorch the Earth**. If I see any opportunity to remove evil, it is my duty to do so. I never allow a vanquished enemy to threaten me again.

 **Seek Out Contamination**. To protect the pure, all possible agents of impurity must be annihilated. I know that not all threats are apparent, and that nobody should fear me unless they too are a threat.

 **Foster Purity**. I am as the doctor who cauterizes the wound. When I am not on the front lines, it is my duty to serve the pure, the brave, and the healing.

### Sacred Touch
Each class feature or effect that deals radiant damage instead deals fire damage, including your Divine Smite and Divine Strikes features.

In addition, you can spend one additional die from your pool to make it a Searing Smite. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

<div class="feat">

## Searing Smite
Your weapon flares with white-hot intensity and deals fire damage. If the attack deals damage, the target must succeed with a Constitution saving throw or ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute, it takes 1d6 fire damage.

A creature, including the target, can use an action to put out the flames. The target also gains a new save at the end of each of its turns.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Searing Weapon
    You raise your weapon to shoot forth flames towards your targets. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can spend Devotion to increase the damage dealt by 1d6 per point spent, before targets roll their saves.

- #### Wildfire
    You let out a mighty roar which causes fires to jump and spread wildly, causing each burning object within 25 ft to flare with increased energy.

    Creatures adjacent to or sharing a space with a burning object or creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, it takes fire damage equal to 1d6 + your paladin level and catches fire, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

    If the target or an adjacent creatures uses an action to put out the flames, or the fire is otherwise doused, the ongoing damage ends. The target also gains a new save at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn’t catch fire.

</div>

### Razing Flames
Your spells and features that deal fire damage also burn objects caught in the conflagration. Unattended, non-magical objects caught in such areas of effect are destroyed if the object’s break DC is less than your Strength of devotion save DC.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use this blessing, you must spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to cold and fire damage.

- #### Channel Divinity: Conflagration
    You know this Channel Divinity option in addition to your other options.

    Raising your sword causes it to blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20 ft radius around you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each of your targets is completely shielded from the flames.

    The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

</div>

### Divine Flames
As a ***bonus action*** you can spend 1 Devotion to make your fires burn with divine fury. While you keep your concentration, half of the fire damage you deal becomes radiant damage.

### Burning Path
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to wreath yourself in flames. For 1 minute you gain the following benefits:

- The flames extends in a 10 ft radius, emanates bright light in a 30 ft radius, and dim light 60 ft beyond that.
- Whenever a hostile creature enters the wreath of flame for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 40 fire damage.
- You have immunity to fire damage and resistance to cold damage.

</div>

The Oath of Radiance is as old as the sun that it follows. Often called sun warriors or shining knights, paladins that swear to this oath seek to bring light and knowledge to even the darkest areas of the world. They adorn their armor with images of the sun and the stars, holy lights that bring life and knowledge to this world, revealing all that is hidden by shadow and darkness.

#### Tenets of Radiance
Most paladins of the Oath of Radiance share these tenets:

 **Truth**. Reveal truth from the darkness.

 **Leadership**. Guide people along the right path. Be the light that everyone else follows.

 **Preservation**. Where there already is light and truth, be the first one to stand in its defense.

 **Hope**. Nothing is inevitable. When light is being consumed by darkness, continue fighting until your final breath. There is always a better outcome be had.

### Revealing the Hidden
When you take this oath, you excel at finding what is hidden. Add *Investigation* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on this skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, your weapon gleams with astral radiance and the target becomes visible if it’s invisible. It sheds dim light in a 5 ft radius and can’t become invisible for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute.

In addition you gain access to the following divine blessing:

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Banish Dazzle***. You become immune to being blinded by light, can see through nonmagical mirages and optical illusions, and have advantage on saving throws against spells that create visual illusions or cause blindness through light, color, or flame, such as blinding smite, color spray, or holy aura.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Revelation
    A bright light shines down in a 40 ft high cylinder with a 10 ft radius centered on a point within range. The light dispels illusions and magical darkness, and remains for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration.

    When an invisible creature, shapechanger or creature transformed through magic enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one.

    If the creature fails, it also instantly becomes visible, or reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the light.

    On each of your turns, you can use an ***action*** to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

- #### Blinding intervention
    As a ***bonus action***, you can raise your weapon to make it flash of blinding light. Each target must make at a Constitution saving throw, becoming blinded on a failed save. A creature blinded by this spell makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

</div>

### Aura of Light
You may choose to be surrounded by an aura of light. While this aura is active, you shed bright light in a 10 ft radius, and dim light for 50 ft beyond that. Friendly creatures within the bright light have advantage on death saves.

At 18th level, the range of the bright light increases to 30 ft, and the dim light to 60 ft beyond that.

<div class="columnstwo">

| 15th | Protective Spirit |
| 20th | Emissary of Redemption |

</div>

Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk.

These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.

While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.

Paladins following this oath are not uncommonly ex-criminals or individuals who feels they have squandered their life away on fruitless endeavors and seek to instead do some good with what time they have left, and start on a path of selflessness and valor.

#### Tenets of Redemption
The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.

 **Forgiveness**. We are all flawed and I am no exception; I must always remember not to judge others based on my own viewpoint and preconceptions, but rather by trying to see the other side of things.

 **Peace**. Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to longlasting peace.

 **Patience**. Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.

 **Wisdom**. Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.

### Negotiator
Divine power guides your efforts for peace and settlement. When you take this oath, gain the *Speechcraft - Tact* skill and its prerequisite.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite and Divine Strikes features, you also force the target to face its guilt. The extra damage dealt is psychic damage.

If you deal only 1 extra psychic damage, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Halting Presence
    You can use your Channel Divinity to forcefully shout a command for enemies to halt. Targets that fail a Wisdom saving throw cannot make any actions, except reactions. This lasts until you do not use an action to hold the spell or lose concentration. In addition, targets can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns, to end the effect on themself only.

    This has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

- #### Rebuke the Violent
    You can rebuke those who use violence. As a ***reaction***  after an attacker within 30 ft deals damage against a creature other than you, force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

</div>

### Aura of Absolution
You and any friendly creatures within 10 ft have advantage on saves against mental effects while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this effect increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following Divine Blessings, each costing at least 3 Devotion.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Protection from Energy***. You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage.

- ***Sentinel of Nature***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage.

</div>

### Protective Spirit
A holy presence mends your wounds after battle. You regain hit points equal to half your paladin level if you begin a short rest with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren’t incapacitated.

### Emissary of Redemption
You become an avatar of peace.

- You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures.
- Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.

If you attack a creature, target it with a spell or effect, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Voice of Certainty,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Certitude |
| 13th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 15th | Soul of Disdain |
| 20th | Aspect of Perfection |

</div>

Taking the Oath of Supremacy is a declaration that your cause is the one, the true, and the only; to use the word “best” would imply a sense of competition. Paladins may proclaim the moral supremacy of any single cause, such as their faith, ideal, leader, movement, order, race, or sect. Such paladins indicate their elite status by donning the telltale emblems of their cause, be it their national colors, their order’s sigil, or their leader’s dress code. Outsiders refer to them as supremacists or gold knights, but these paladins would prefer to be greeted as brothers and sisters of the faith.

#### Tenets of Supremacy
The tenets of the Oath of Supremacy vary by paladin and cause, but all guide the paladin to be an elite entity in an inferior world.

 **Power**. Assert your superiority through unwavering confidence and domination.

 **Self-Assurance**. Your actions are just, and you need not answer for them. However you treat others, that is what they deserve.

 **All for the Cause**. For the community of your cause, you must serve, sacrifice, and obey.

### Voice of Certainty
When you take this oath, you act with unwavering confidence. You gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Speechcraft* skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, you can spend one additional die from your pool to make it a Wrathful Smite. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

<div class="feat">

## Wrathful Smite
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Invoke Fealty
    You can use your Channel Divinity to compel a foe to kneel before you. Pointing to a creature within 10 ft, you fill it with fear and awe. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or fall prone, groveling.

    While groveling, the creature’s speed is reduced to 0 and it cannot take actions or reactions as long as you keep concentration. The target has advantage on its saving throw if it has more hit points than you. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends.

- #### Vow of Disdain
    As a ***bonus action***, you can utter a vow of disdain against a creature you can see within 10 ft. The vow shrouds you in warding energy for one minute, or until you or the target drop to 0 hit points or fall unconscious. While affected by your vow of disdain, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks against you.

</div>

### Aura of Certitude
You and all friendly creatures within 10 ft gain a bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws equal to your Strength modifier.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
*You gain access to the following Divine Blessings.*

To use one of these blessings, you must spend at least 3 Devotion. They can only be used on yourself.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ***Sacred Armor***. You focus divine power into your shield or your armor. For ***1 minute*** you add half your Charisma modifier (round up) to your AC and are immune to critical hits. Your armor or shield also emits bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light for 20 ft beyond that. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, or are no longer wearing this armor or holding the shield this effect ends.

- ***Sentinel of Superiority***. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing ***and*** slashing damage.

</div>

### Soul of Disdain
You need not waste your time to deal with the foe denounced by your Vow of Disdain. When a creature affected by your Vow of Disdain makes an attack, they instantly take radiant damage equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier.

### Aspect of Perfection
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to ascend to a more perfect form. As you approach perfection, you emanate a holy glow, and gusts of ethereal wind follow your movements. Your body itself may also change by adding muscle mass, healing from old scars, aging to become more proud and intimidating, or returning to the beauty and power of youth.

For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain resistance to all damage, except psychic damage.
- You gain the benefits of the *haste* spell, and do not have to maintain concentration on it.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-tomorrow">Oath of Tomorrow</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Mechanist, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Strengthening the Divine |
| 7th | Aura of Progress |
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 13th | Prayer: Fabricate |
| 15th | Electric Feedback |

</div>

To some, the age of a world is marked by its changes, the advancements and progress made in thought, machinery, and life. The club gives way to the spear, then the sword; crude sorceries and pacts give way to wizardly arcana; and the wandering tribe becomes a village, then a city, then an empire. Society itself grows, shaking off yesterday's technology and tinkering with new mechanics, new magics, new lives.

Those who swear the oath of tomorrow believe in the virtue of this progress and strive to push the world forward, opposing reactionaries who would stand against such. They are guardians of universities, inquisitive natural philosophers, and advocates for the power of machinery and other forms of artificial locomotion.

In many circles of thinkers, these paladins are called philosopher-knights and morrowbringers, and they may follow gods of technology, such as Gond or Brigh, or swear fealty to deities of logic and progress, like Draxis. Others yet may worship none, instead espousing pure reason as greater than faith. Be they pure machinists or fiery advocates for social rearrangement, these paladins wield powers from their personal vision of the future as they quest to put an end to the most recent chapter of history.

> *"The present is theirs. The future, for which I really worked, is mine."*
>
> -- Nikola Tesla

#### Tenets of Tomorrow
The tenets of tomorrow are a newly crafted vow, often mutating to better fit the rapidly progressing world philosopher-knights and morrowbringers seek after.

 **Change**. Stagnation is death. Always drive experimentation, new ways of thinking, and cultural progress.

 **Pure Reason**. Mortals should be rational beings. The power of your reason will unlock secrets to greater futures.

 **Mortals are Limitless**. Defy the irrational chains placed upon what mortal civilization can and cannot accomplish. There is a future grandeur just waiting to be achieved.

 **Kill the Past**. The society of the past did not know what you do now. It is a scar reminding mortals of what they thought they couldn't do. Let history die in its cobwebs.

### Mechanist
You have envisioned a mechanical future and labor to bring it to pass. When you take this oath, add *Engineering* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on this skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, you can spend one additional die from your pool to make it a Deconstructing Smite. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

<div class="feat">

## Deconstructing Smite
If the target is a construct, and is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer with this attack, it stops functioning, i.e. becomes stunned. If it has more than 50 hp, it avoids the effect on a successful Constitution save.

It remains like this for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute, or until it receives damage, at which point it starts functioning again.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Implements of Progress
    A 10 ft radius around you is covered by tools of progress, either grease or steam, for 1 minute. In both cases the effect spreads around corners.

    If you select ***grease***, the ground becomes very slippery, turning it into difficult terrain. Each creature except you that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

    If you select ***steam***, the area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

- #### Turn the Antiquated
    You offer an indictment of that which would hold back progress. Each aberration or dragon that can see or hear you within 30 ft must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move within 30 ft of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

</div>

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    To use one of these blessings, you must spend at least 1 Devotion.

    ***Empower Invention***. You imbue your weapon with electricity. For ***1 minute***, attacks made with that weapon become magical, inflict extra lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier, and emits bright light in a 10 ft radius and dim light 10 ft beyond that.

    Alternatively, you can use this on a friendly construct. For ***1 minute***, its damage is magical, it inflict extra lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier and emits bright light in a 10 ft radius and dim light 10 ft beyond that.

- #### Prayer: Embrace Destiny
    Your prayer reveals a murky vision of things to come. Roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Before the start of your next long rest you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with the foretold roll. You must choose to do this before the affected roll is made. Once the foretold roll is used it is lost.

    This prayer can only be made once between each long rest.

</div>

### Aura of Progress
You radiate divine advancement, shielding creatures against stupor and stagnation. You and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you are immune to being paralyzed or stunned while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
*Add this to your Channel Divinity options.*

#### Channel Divinity: Heat Metal
This option can only target manufactured metal objects, such as a metal weapon or a suit of metal armor. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with a targeted object takes 2d8 fire damage per object.

If the creature is holding the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

### Prayer: Fabricate
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

You pray over raw materials to convert into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool. You can fabricate a Small or smaller object (contained within a 3 ft cube, like a chest of lute), given a sufficient quantity of raw material.

If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Tiny (small enough to hold in your hand). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency to craft such objects.

### Electric Feedback
Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, it takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

### Avant Guardian
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to manifest your advocacy for progress in your own visage, fusing flesh, magic, and steel. Using your ***action***, you undergo the transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- Your grow to large size, and your equipment grows with you, doubling your reach.
- You are immune to poison, psychic, and lightning damage.
- You are immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, petrified, or poisoned, and magic cannot put you to sleep.
- You are resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage inflicted by weapons that are not made of adamantine.
- Your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional die of damage and count as magical if they do not already.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-tradition">Oath of Tradition</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Divine Sense, Historian,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: Funeral Rite |
| 7th | Aura of Reverence |
| 9th | Prayers |
| 13th | Guardian Spirits |
| 15th | Prayer: Commune with Spirits |
| 20th | Bridge to the Past |

</div>

The world survives on the foundation of what has gone before: Today's peace was hewn won by forebears' blood, and today's world was hewn by yesterday's kings. Every mortal springs forth from this foundation of history, born to parents, growing through society, and learning from the mistakes and successes of yore. Despite this, the past is an ephemeral thing, surviving on the merits of fragile archives and errant memory. And when a mortal dies, they are removed from this plane, doomed to be forgotten if care is not taken.

Those who swear the Oath of Tradition recognize the value of history, of lore, of the past. Called knight-chroniclers or yore-guards by some, these paladins are protectors of traditional institutions as well as keepers of those stories that would otherwise be forgotten, be it the grand epic of a dead empire, recorded on but one surviving manuscript, or the joyful memories of an elder recollecting the first harvest festival of a village no longer so young.

These paladins can be found in service to gods of home and civilization, such as Estanna or Erathis, under the authority of grand archives and keepers of history, or in temples and shrines dedicated to the remembrance and veneration of deceased ancestry. Many can be found questing through the world in search for stories that would otherwise be forgotten. Others travel in order to stand in opposition to forces that threaten to destroy what came before.

> *"History is a people's memory, and without a memory, man is demoted to the lower animals."*
>
> -- Malcolm X

#### Tenets of Tradition
Different cultures vary slightly in how each articulates the oath of tradition. Nevertheless, it is universally handed down from effectively antiquity, no matter the place or time of its bearer.

 **Heritage**. Carry on the old traditions, yesterday's way of life, connecting the past to the present and enlivening both.

 **Remembrance**. Write the stories of people and cultures and places upon both crude matter and upon your mind. By remembering these tales, that which is gone yet lives.

 **Joy**. Celebrate successful preservation, revel in surviving legends, and savor traditions still observed. When heritage is respected, all become part of something more.

 **Sorrow**. When history is lost, when stories are forgotten, when cultures die, and when traditions are trampled, weep. Mourn ancient beauty and horror alike, for it mattered.

### Divine Sense
Your Divine Sense feature also detects the presence of magic.

### Historian
When you take this oath, you are keenly familiar with the world of the past and its stories. Add *History* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on this skill.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Divine Smite feature, you can spend one additional die from your pool to make it a Deconstructing Smite. You can spend a single die for no extra damage.

<div class="feat">

## Deconstructing Smite
If the target is a construct, and is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer with this attack, it stops functioning, i.e. becomes stunned. If it has more than 50 hp, it avoids the effect on a successful Constitution save.

It remains like this for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute, or until it receives damage, at which point it starts functioning again.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Invoke Legacy
    You call upon the spirits of those who have passed, granting your targets inspiration. Each target gains a Spirit die. A Spirit die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 10 minutes have passed, a target instead gains 1d8 temprary hp.

- #### Turn Machination
    You can use your Channel Divinity to abjure fabricated locomotion. Each construct or undead that can see or hear you within 30 ft of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

</div>

### Funeral Rite
*You know this Prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

You perform a funeral rite for a dead ally or acquaintance. In addition to the effects of the Gentle Repose Prayer, anyone attending the funeral who knew the deceased is inspired by its memory, gaining a bonus Inspiration that can be used once. Each time you use Inspiration, you can choose to use your bonus Inspiration or a 'regular' Inspiration.

### Aura of Reverence
Your presence wards against desecration and decay. While you are conscious, dead creatures within 10 ft cannot be reanimated as undead. Additionally, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 ft takes necrotic damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to grant that creature resistance to that instance of necrotic damage.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Prayers
You learn one additional Prayer or your choice, and also gain access to the following oath specific prayers.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Know Customs
    The spirits that have long lives in the area grants you knowledge of the customs, laws, mores and social etiquette of the tribes, village or other settlement in the area. The spirits reveal only such knowledge that would be commonly known by most people in the area.

    Typical information revealed includes common courtesies (outsiders must avert their eyes when addressing local officials), restrictions (no dogs are allowed inside the city limits), important festivals and so forth.

- #### Speak with Dead
    Your prayer grants the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this prayer within the last 10 days.

    While you are performing the prayer, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

    Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

</div>

### Guardian Spirits
You can spend 4 Devotion to summon spirits of your ancestors. Their spectral forms flit around you to a distance of 15 ft. The first time each round a creature in the area makes an attack against you or your allies, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When 10 minutes have past, or the guardian spirits have dealt 60 or more damage, they disappear.

### Prayer: Commune with Spirits
*You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

You commune with the spirits of the past to gain answers to your questions, either specific questions or more general queries.

 ***General***. Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spirits will give you a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

 The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spirits might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips.”

 ***Specific***. You ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. Spirits aren’t omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond their  knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary, they might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you use this prayer two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each use after the first that you get no answer.

### Bridge to the Past
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to channel the legacy of history. For 1 minute, you are surrounded by spirit beings who confer the following benefits:

- You can touch and make melee attacks against creatures within 30 ft of you.
- When you take the attack action, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
- You gain the benefit of three-quarters cover against all ranged attacks targeting you and of half-cover against all melee attacks targeting you.
- Space within 30 ft is considered difficult terrain for hostile creatures.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-vengeance">Oath of Vengeance</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Hunter, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Relentless Avenger |
| 15th | Soul of Vengeance |
| 17th | Strengthening the Divine |
| 20th | Avenging Angel |

</div>

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins, sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.

Born to the sword, the avenger has experienced first-hand the devastation that violence can cause. He accepts any cost to have his vengeance, even to the forfeit of his very soul. What does not kill him makes him stronger. His anger is personal and unfettered; a hatred that is as like to consume his own soul as it is the foes they have sworn to destroy.

> *"I don't care what it does to me, I only care what I can do to them."*
>
> -- Shovan the Marked, avenger of justice


#### Tenets of Vengeance
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

 **Fight the Greater Evil**. Faced with a choice to ally with a lesser evil to fight my sworn foes, I choose the lesser evil. The enemy of my enemy is my friend... for now. Know how to leverage valuable assets in your quest for retaliation.

 **No Mercy for the Wicked**. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

 **Restitution**. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

 **Vengeance at all Costs**. The marring of your own soul, even a fall to evil, is an acceptable compromise in order to do what must be done. There is no price too high or feat too great when revenge is at hand. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

### Hunter
You are keen to identify danger, injustice, and your quarry's trail. When you take this oath, gain the *Survival - Tracking* skill and its prerequisite.

### Sacred Touch
When you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Vengeful Smite.

<div class="feat">

## Vengeful Smite
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.

If the target succeeds on a save against this blessing, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each Devotion you spent.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Abjure Enemy
    By speaking a prayer of denunciation, your targets are forced to make a Wisdom saving throw, unless immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.

    On a failed save, the targets are frightened for 1 minute or until they takes any damage. While frightened this way, a creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

- #### Vow of Enmity
    You utter a vow of enmity against a single creature you can see within 10 ft and mark it as your target of vengeance. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute, until you lose concentration or until it drops to 0 hit points. While marked, you also have advantage on any Perception or Tracking checks you make to find it.

    If you spend 3 Devotion when Channeling, the duration is extended to the end of your next long rest (which allows you to renew it).

</div>

### Relentless Avenger
Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Soul of Vengeance
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

### Strengthening the Divine
You know the following two options in addition to your other known Channel Divinity options and Prayers.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Channel Divinity: Relentless
    As a ***reaction*** when a creature within 30 ft teleports, plane shifts or uses any other means of extradimensional transport, your willing targets are transported within 10 ft of the creature

- #### Prayer: Scrying
    As long as the target of your Vow of Enmity is on the same plane of existence, you can attempt to observe it. If the target succeeds with a Wisdom saving throw, it isn’t affected, and you can’t use this prayer against it again for until after a long rest.

    On a failed save, an invisible sensor appears within 10 ft of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 ft of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

</div>


### Avenging Angel
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to assume the form of an angelic avenger. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:

- Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 ft.
- You emanate an aura of menace in a 30 ft radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
- You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures frightened of you.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-waves">Oath of the Waves</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Oceanic, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Speak with Animals |
| 7th | Echolocation, Water Breathing |
| 13th | Control Water |
| 15th | Stunning Strike |
| 20th | Form of the Leviathan |

</div>

The fight against corruption and evil doesn't stop at the shoreline. Paladins who follow gods of the ocean, such as Poseidon, or who are born among marine races, often follow the Oath of the Waves.

As with other marine classes, aquatic paladins focus on training with piercing weapons such as spears, tridents, and short swords, as well as crossbows. Their armor is rarely made of metals, unless they are enchanted. Instead, their armors are composed of unique species of leathery seaweed, scales, chitinous plates, and shields made of turtle shells.

#### Tenets of Devotion
Paladins following the Oath of the Waves usually adhere to the following tenets:

 **Bounty**. Food and water are the cornerstones of life and the ocean is generous. I will not overlook starvation or thirst without compassion for those who suffer.

 **Freedom**. Of all evils, slavery of mind and body shall be fought above all others.

 **One World**. Waters are the foundation of life. Through travel and experience, I will learn all I can about the cultures of the world. Only through knowledge and understanding can good root out evil.

 **The Unnatural Shall Not Fester**. Aberrations and undead must be destroyed beyond all resurrection lest their evil infect the world.

### Oceanic
The sea is like a home to you. When you take this oath, gain the *Survival - Coast survival* and *Survival - Ocean survival* skills and their prerequisite.

### Sacred Touch
You gain access to the following divine blessing, which does not require you to keep concentration.

<div class="columnstwo">

-  ***Aquatic Adaption***. You can hold your breath 10 times the normal, gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and can see underwater as if you had 30 ft darkvision.

    If you become unconscious while underwater and under the effects of Aquatic Adaption, you do not start to drown. Instead you are kept in stasis and gently float up toward the surface at a speed of 20 ft.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You learn the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Censure the Deep
    You speak a prayer censuring aberrations, undead and aquatic creatures. Each such creture within 30 ft that see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 ft of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

- #### Shockwave
    A shockwave pushes out from you, forcing each creature in a 15 ft radius to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 ft away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

    In addition, unsecured objects within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 ft away from you.

</div>

### Speak with Animals
You can spend 1 Devotion to gain the ability to communicate with aquatic beasts for 10 minutes. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM’s discretion.

### Echolocation
You can use a ***bonus action*** to grant yourself blindsight to a range of 15 ft until the beginning of your next turn. If you are underwater, this range increases to 60 ft. As this ability is based on hearing, you may not use it if you are deafened.

### Water Breathing
Whenever you use a Divine blessing, the target additionally can breathe underwater while the blessing is active.

### Control Water
You can spend 4 Devotion to control water inside is a cube up to 100 ft on a side. For 10 minutes you can create the following effects by spending an ***action***.

-  ***Part Water***. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains for the full duration or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
-  ***Redirect Flow***. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose for the full duration or you choose a different effect.
-  ***Whirlpool***. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 ft square and 25 ft deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 ft wide at the base, up to 50 ft wide at the top, and 25 ft tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 ft of the vortex is pulled 10 ft toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Swim check against your strength of devotion save DC.

  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the check to do so.

### Stunning Strike
When you use your Shockwave Channel Divinity option, the damage increases to 4d8. In addition, creatures that fail their save are stunned for 1 round.

You can instead focus your shockwave towards a single creature within 30 ft. If you do, the creature gains disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Form of the Leviathan
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to assume the form of an ancient force from the deep, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn blue-green or become scaled, you may grow multiple tentacles or your legs may become fused like a whale or shark.

For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- Your size increases by one step.
- Your Strength and Constitution both become 20 if they aren't already.
- You have advantage on Strength and Constitution checks and you gain 4d10 temporary hit points.
- You gain the ability to breath water and gain a swim speed of 60 ft.
- Your Shockwave counts as a critical hit if a target fails its saving throw.








<hr class="classdivider">
<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-blood">Restricted to Dhampir characters</a></h2>
<h1>Oath of Blood</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Draining Bite, Sacred Touch,<br>Vampiric Nature |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity, Protean Form |
| 7th | Blood Thirst, Dark Aura
| 15th | Undead Regeneration
| 17th | Domination
| 20th | Vampiric Form

</div>

Unlike a regular Dhampir, you are a real vampire; a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. By some means — whether by the lifedraining attack of an elder vampire, an ancient doom laid upon your family, the foul magic of a hateful enemy, or even by seeking immortal power yourself through ancient rites and alchemical formulas — the curse of vampirism fell upon you.

Rather than falling to it completely, however, you called upon the oaths of a paladin's fealty, and swore to use your dark nature in the service of a cause. The divine nature of your oath holds your curse at bay, but you are still infused with the power of darkness. Having already experienced death, you are a lethal creature of the night. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains. As your power increases, your supernatural nature comes to the fore — but will your humanity pay the price?

#### Tenets of the Loyal Retainer
You struggle unrelentingly to control the monstrous urges of your vampiric nature.

 **Moderation**. If you deny your monstrous bloodthirst entirely, it will eventually erupt and consume you. You seek the wisdom to indulge that hunger occasionally, in small ways, but only enough to keep it from overwhelming your reason.

 **Zealotry**. The only thing that allows you to master the hunger of a vampire is your devotion to your cause, and so you put that cause first, above all things, including your own survival.

  **Forbearance**. The urge to consume mortal lifeblood is strong, but perhaps never so strong as when inflamed by passion—you shun all personal intimacy and romantic interaction, knowing the danger you pose to anyone you let yourself become close to.

 **Loyalty**. Those who accept you for what you are take a grave chance, and transcend their natural instincts of fear and revulsion to maintain your company. They are a treasure greater than gold, and must be protected accordingly.

### Draining Bite
If you are below half you maximum hit points and do not have all your Hit Die, you can drain the blood of others. You can bite this way by making an unarmed strike against a willing creature, a creature that is incapacitated or restrained, or a creature that is grappled by you. Constructs, undead and other creatures that do no have blood are immune to this attack.

If the attack hits, you inflict 1d4 piercing damage and extra necrotic damage equal to half your paladin level (rounded up). The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. You regain hit points equal to that amount and 1 Hit Die.

When you inflict damage on a creature this way, your inhuman nature manifests itself. For 1 minute, you count as undead instead of humanoid, and are affected normally by effects that target undead.

### Sacred Touch
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessing
    This blessing can only be used on yourself, and requires you to spend at least 1 Devotion.

    ***Spider Climb***. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

- #### Hypnotizing Gaze
    By meeting the gaze of a humanoid within 30 ft, you can attempt to charm it. This takes a few rounds, which makes it impossible to do in combat, but works fine while in a conversation. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance for 1 hour or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. After the duration, or if you lose concentration, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

</div>

### Vampiric Nature
When you take this oath, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain darkvision at a range of 60 ft.
- You gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage unless it is inflicted by silver.
- Any creature charmed by you is a willing target for your Draining Bite Channel Divinity ability. For purposes of spells and other charming effects, your Draining Bite does not count as harming it.
- You can take the Dash action as a ***bonus action*** on your turn.

However, you also gain the following weaknesses:
- You have vulnerability to radiant damage.
- You take psychic damage equal to twice your paladin level if you enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants, end your turn in running water, or begin your turn in direct sunlight. This damage cannot be reduced or redirected by any means.
- When you would normally regain all of your Hit Dice, if you have not inflicted damage on a creature with your Draining Bite Channel Divinity ability in the past 24 hours, you immediately expend two Hit Dice without gaining any hit points.

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Might
    With a quick prayer, you augment the skills and strength of your targets. Each target gains a Divine Might die. This die can be used to add a d8 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make.

    This can be made after making the roll but before the results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 1 minute has passed, a target instead heals 1d8 hp.

- ### Protean Form
    As a ***bonus action***, you can spend 1 Devotion to transform yourself into a bat, rat, raven or wolf. You can stay in this beast shape up to a number of hours equal to half your paladin level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While transformed, all the rules that apply to a druid transformed by their wild shape feature apply to you.

    You gain more options as you gain paladin levels. At 5th level, you can spend 2 Devotion to become a giant bat, giant rat, swarm of bats, swarm of rats, or swarm of ravens.

    When you reach 9th level, you can spend 3 Devotion to turm into a mist, functioning similar to the *gaseous form* spell.

</div>

### Blood Thirst
If a creature within 30 ft is reduced to 0 hit points but is not killed, you must roll a Wisdom saving throw if you have not inflicted damage on a creature with your Draining Bite in the past 24 hours. The base DC is 15, but it is increased by 1 for every 24 hours that have passed since the last time you inflicted damage on a creature with Draining Bite. If you succeed, you are immune to this effect until the next time you finish a short rest.

If you fail, on your next action you must move as fast as you can towards the fallen creature and make an attack action against them, using your Draining Bite if possible. Otherwise use the most damaging attack you have.

### Dark Aura
You no longer age, and you cannot be aged magically. In addition, creatures of your choice within 10 ft have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

At 18th level, the range of this effect increases to 30 ft.

### Undead Regeneration
At the beginning of your turn, if you have used your Draining Bite since you the end of your last long rest, and have less than half of your maximum hit points remaining, you heal 5 hit points.

### Domination
When you use the Hypnotizing Gaze feature, the target is under stronger control, and you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature, which it does its best to obey.

You can use your ***action*** to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own ***reaction*** as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the effect.

### Vampiric Form
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a fly speed of 30 ft.
- The first time you are reduced to 0 hit points during the duration, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point, you teleport 30 ft and immediately turn into mist as if you had used you Protean Form.
- You become undead, and are no longer affected by effects that target humanoids (though you are affected by effects that target undead).
- You are immune to necrotic damage and features that turn undead.
- When you use your Draining Bite without restrictions.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-festivity">Restricted to Eladrin or Halfling culture</a></h2>
<h1>Oath of Festivity</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Good Host, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity,<br>Prayer: Rejuvenation |
| 7th | Aura of Revelry
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine
| 15th | Dramatic Entrance
| 20th | Life of the Party

</div>

The Oath of Festivity appeals to paladins with an unquenchable zest for life and the need to spread it to others. When times are darkest and gloom casts a shadow over the people, these paladins are there to bring joy back into the lives of their comrades and allies. Also called Motley knights, these paladins fight in armor adorned with vibrant cloth, bright paints, and glittering stones, and act as shining beacons of genuine excitement that stand against evils that douse the world in darkness, gore, and misery.

However, they do not take disturbing or saccharine pleasure in the destruction of their foes. Nor are they tactlessly excitable in grim circumstances. Somber encouragement or a stiff drink offered without a word can restore the spirit as much as a feast, though occasions for feasts and revels are to be taken at every opportunity.

#### Tenets of Festivity
The tenets of this oath call its adherents to care for the well-being of others as well as themselves.

 **Fun**. Life is a gift and every day a celebration to be relished. Create opportunities to enjoy it and alleviate boredom and misery wherever it exists.

 **Joy**. Act as a persistent comfort to the hurting, and a source of happiness for those without it. Create experiences that will never be forgotten.

 **Plenty**. No celebration is complete without abundant food and drink, and no life can be happy if it wants for basic necessities. Ensure there is comfortable excess in all things.

 **Hospitality**. There is always room for another chair at the bar, another seat at the table, and another friend in your heart. Bring others into the fold and share with them.

### Good Host
Add *Cooking* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point each to spend on *Cooking* and *Speechcraft*.

### Sacred Touch
When you use the Lay on Hands feature, you always remove any poison effects on the target, as well granting it temporary hit points equal to half your level, rounded up.

### Channel Divinity
You know the following two Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Merriment
    By raising a glass in a toast, all creatures joining in will feel a bit drunk and merrier already after the first sip. A creature failing a Constitution saving throw will gain the Charmed condition against you and poisoned for 1 hour, until you lose concentration, or until any hostilities ensue between an ally and any of the targets.

    This can obviously not be done in combat.

- #### Rebuke the Sober
    You can use your Channel Divinity to bring revelry to others, whether they want it or not. Each target that fails a Wisdom saving throw becomes really drunk. It falls prone, becomes incapacitated and unable to stand up for 1 minut or until you lose concentration.

    At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, a target can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

    A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected.

</div>

### Rejuvenation
In quiet moments before startin a long rest, you can prepare a source of relief for others, such as comfort food, a stiff drink, or kind words. Any creature that can see or hear you regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier and reduces fatigue one step.

### Aura of Revelry
Your incorrigible excitement suppresses fatigue. While you are conscious, you and friendly creatures within 10 ft do not suffer the effects of the blinded, deafened, exhausted, poisoned, and unconscious conditions, unless at 0 hit points. Affected creatures are not cured of any conditions they suffer, and the effects return when a creature leaves your aura.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Hypnotic Pattern
    As an ***action*** you can spend 3 Devotion to create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air up to 120 ft away, which remains for a minute or until you lose concentration. Each creature within 30 ft of the pattern when it appears must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains the charmed condition, is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

    The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

- #### Prayer: Commune with Civilization
    *You know this prayer in addition to your other prayers.*

    You briefly become one with the soul of festivity and gain limited knowledge of surrounding settlements within 3 miles. You instantly gain know of places of merriment and festivity, such as taverns, festival places or praces of worship in the area.

    In addition you get an intuitive knowledge of the customs, laws, mores and social etiquette followed within. This only grants knowledge that would be known by most inhabitans of the settlement. Typical information revealed includes common courtesies (outsiders must avert their eyes when addressing local officials), restrictions (no dogs are allowed inside the city limits), important festivals and so forth.

</div>

### Dramatic Entrance
You gain an impeccable sense of dramatic timing that allows you to enter the fray with a thrilling buildup and explosive introduction. From the beginning of any combat until the start of your first turn, you have advantage on checks and saving throws, and during your first turn you can take an additional action, which cannot be used for as an attack action.

In addition, you cannot be surprised.

### Life of the Party
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to transform into a brilliant source of reinvigorating joy for 10 minutes. In this state you gain the following benefits:

- You radiate rays of multicolored bright light in a 300 ft radius, which dispel magical darkness and reveal illusions, which appear as ghostly, monochrome apparitions. The light also reveals creatures that are hidden or in the ethereal plane. You can choose to exclude a creature or illusion from this effect.
- You and creatures of your choice within 60 ft cannot be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or stunned, and any levels of exhaustion a creature is suffering are removed when it starts its turn within 60 ft of you.
- The first time a creature enters this aura or starts its turn there, you can grant it the the benefits of the Death Ward prayer, which last until your transformation ends. Once a creature gains this benefit, it cannot do so again until your next transformation.






<hr class="classdivider">
<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-revenant">Restricted to Awakened characters</a></h2>
<h1>Oath of the Revenant</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Insatiable |
| 9th | Phantom Steed |
| 15th | Ghastly Constitution |
| 20th | Dead One’s Own |

</div>


The Oath of the Revenant is a oath that a paladin does not necessarily take, but is fulfilled by one whose soul aligns with the goals of the creature creating the specific oath. Paladins who swear this oath come from the dead of centuries long past, brought back to the land of the living to fulfill the ideals they share with their resurrector. Paladins sworn to this oath live only to complete a definite goal given to them, and once it is complete their soul returns to the afterlife.

### Tenets of the Revenant
The tenets of the Oath of the Revenant vary from revenant to revenant, based primarily on fulfilling the goals of the one who is responsible for bringing them back to life. There are, though, four core principles that each revenant strives to uphold beyond anything else.

 **Risen to Serve**. You have been given life and flesh once more to fulfill the goals of your master. There is no question as to if you can serve your purpose, you will.

 **Cherish the Living**. To have life breathed into you once again is a precious thing, and it is your duty to safeguard the lives of those you serve.

 **No Rest.** Duty comes before all worldly things. Hedonism serves only to tarnish your ability to achieve your goals.

 **Complete the Mission**. Personal goals no longer have meaning, as they died with your true body long ago. The sole purpose of your revived existence is to see to completion the goals you were given, nothing else.

### Sacred Touch
When you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Frightful Smite.

<div class="feat">

## Frightful Smite
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. If the target succeeds on a save against this blessing, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each Devotion you spent.

</div>

In addition, you gain access to the following blessing:

 ***Undead Nature***. This blessing can only be used on yourself. Whenever an intimidated or frightened creature hits you with a melee attack, it takes 5 necrotic damage.

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Grave Defense
    As a ***bonus action***, you can bolster your targets' defenses. Each target gains temporary hit points equal to your paladin level.

- #### Spirits of the Dead
    You raise your weapon, requesting aid of the spirits from your past life. The intangible spirits lash out and claw at your targets, dealing 2d8 necrotic damage and 2d8 psychic damage, and making the target frightened until the end of your next turn.

    Each target that succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw takes half damage and is not frightened. You can spend 3 Devotion to double the damage dealt, but you have to decide before targets roll their saves.

</div>

### Insatiable
Your ability to strike down foes while they suffer from their wounds grows greater. When a hostile creature is reduced below half of their maximum hit points, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

### Phantom Steed
You can spend 3 Devition to summon a Large quasi-real, horselike creature that allows you to ride it. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit and bridle. Any of the equipment vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 ft and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. After 1 hour, the steed gradually fades, giving you 1 minute to dismount. It disappears immediately if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

### Ghastly Constitution
You are immune to being charmed, exhausted, and poisoned. Further, whenever you take a long rest, you can instead stand vigilant as still and cold as death itself. In this state you appear standing dead, but you remain conscious and you can see and hear as normal.

### Dead One's Own
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to channel the aspect of the undead nature and carry a mantle of dark power. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to all damage.
- You regain 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns.
- After you have taken the Attack action on your turn, you can use your ***bonus action*** to deal 20 necrotic or poison damage (your choice) to a creature within 30 ft that you can see and have not dealt damage to that turn.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-stonelord">Restricted to Dwarven characters</a></h2>
<h1>Oath of the Stonelord</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Defender of Dwarves,<br>Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Hammer Throw
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine
| 15th | Stoneblood
| 20th | Champion of Stone

</div>

Dwarves know more secrets about stone than anyone. They live and die among the stones, and the earth whispers to them - or at least to select individuals. These special dwarves are known as stonelords. They use their connection with the earth to draw from the infinite reserves of power within it to help them perform amazing feats.

A stonelord is a devoted sentinel of dwarven enclaves, drawing the power of the earth and ancient stone to protect her people.

#### Tenets of the Stonelord
A stonelord's duty is first to protect her people, but defending the works and traditions of her culture follow at a close second. These paladins are dedicated to protecting not just the lives but the lifestyles of those under their charge and hold the ways of their chosen people as holy, especially when they are the centuries-old ways of an entire race. Their tenets include:

 **My word is my bond**. When I give my word formally, I defend my oath to my death. Traps lie in idle banter or thoughtless talk, and so I watch my tongue.

 **Defender of my people**. I am at all times truthful, honorable, and forthright, but my allegiance is to my people. I will do what is necessary to serve them, including misleading others. Every dwarf is my kin, and they must be protected.

 **Pride in my work**. I respect the forge, and never sully it with halfhearted work. My creations reflect the depth of my faith, and I will not allow flaws save in direst need.

 **Defeat my enemies, but with honor**. Against my people's enemies I will show no mercy. I will defeat them, and I will scatter their families. Yet even in the struggle against our enemies, I will act in a way that brings honor to Moradin.

### Defender of Dwarves
As long as you uphold your tenets you have advantage on Charisma ability checks against dwarves.

### Sacred Touch
You can spend 1 Devotion as a ***reaction*** when taking damage, to reduce damage you take by 2d8.

In addition you gain access to the following divine blessing, which you can only use on yourself:

 ***Armor of Moradin***. You focus divine power into your shield or your armor. For ***1 minute*** you add half your Charisma modifier (round up) to your AC and are immune to critical hits. Your armor or shield also emits bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light for 20 ft beyond that. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, or are no longer wearing this armor or holding the shield this effect ends.

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Quake
    As an ***action*** you can strike the ground, if it is earth or stone, with a bludgeoning weapon, creating a seismic disturbance in a 10 ft radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone  or has lot of object in it (DMs discretion), it becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

    When doing so, you can additionally spend Devotion to increase the effect. For each Devotion spent, you may increase the damage by 1d6 or double the radius (max 80 ft radius).

- #### Moradin's Might
    With a quick prayer, you augment the skills and strength of your targets. Each target gains a Divine Might die. This die can be used to add a d6 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make, or a d10 if target is a dwarf.

    This can be made after making the roll but before results are revealed. If the bonus is not used before 1 minute has passed, a target instead heals hp equal to the die.

</div>

### Hammer Throw
All hammers you wield, including light hammers, mauls, and warhammers, are considered magical and have the Thrown property with a range of 30/60 ft. Hammers you throw return to your hand at the end of your turn.

At 18th level, you can throw a hammer in a 60 ft line as an ***action***. Make a single attack roll and compare it against the AC of each creature in this line, dealing damage normally on a hit.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Channel Divinity: Earthen Grasp
    If the ground is earth or stone, you call forth hands made from the ground to reach for your targets. On a failed Strength save, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for one minute or until you lose concentration.

    As an ***action***, you can cause the hand to crush each restrained target, who takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed Strength save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, a restrained target can make a Strength check against your Strength of devotion  save DC. On a success, the target escapes and the hand pulls back unto the ground.

- #### Prayer: Stone Meld
    A prayer to Moradin allows you to step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for up to 8 hours. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

    While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and checks made to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the effect, but can’t otherwise move.

    Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

</div>

### Stoneblood
You gain immunity to critical hits.

### Champion of Stone
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to turn into living stone. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You are immune to poison and any transmutation effect that change your body.
- You have advantage on saves against magic effects and resistance to all damage, except psychic.
- If you choose you can be completely immovable. You succeed on saves and checks against effects that tries to move you.

<h1>Oath of the Wing Seeker</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Oath Features
| Paladin Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Gliding, Sacred Touch |
| 3rd | Channel Divinity |
| 7th | Aura of Aviation
| 9th | Strengthening the Divine
| 15th | Noisy Feathers
| 20th | True To Your Heart

</div>

While some kenku seek magical knowledge in order to achieve their dream of flight, paladins of the oath of the Wing Seeker wander from their flock, determined to seek the means to end their kin's unjust fate for all. In their quest to end the plight that has plagued their race for some long-forgotten reason for so long, these paladins will follow any and all gods if it gets them closer to unravel the mysteries of their own past and to break the curse that looms over them.

#### Tenets of the Wing Seeeker
The tenets for this oath does not vary, neither in words nor pitch, though the meaning derived from them might differ from paladin to paladin.

  **Slight Courage**. Never fear to act, though *[alarm bell]* caution is *[old man humming]* wise.

  **Pick Your Fights Carefully**. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the *[squeak]* evil.

  **No Mercy for the Wicked**. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my *[flap flap flap]* enemies do not.

  **Be the Flight**. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the *[swoosh]* of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

### Gliding
You've cracked the secret of flight. Almost.

Even though you cannot fly, you can use your wings to some degree. They help with your jumping, allowing you to jump triple the normal distance.

In addition your wings can slow your descent when falling. Your speed of falling is 60 ft per round and you can move up to 30 ft horizontally as well. When you land, you take no falling damage and you can land on your feet.

Using any of these effects requires you to be able to flap your wings.

### Sacred Touch
When you spend Devotion to use Divine Smite, you can forgo rolling 1 or more of your dice to instead use Earthbind Smite. This application of Divine Smite can be used with ranged weapons.

<div class="feat">

## Earthbind Smite
You share your curse with your target. If it fails a Strength saving throw, its flying speed is reduced to 0 ft for 1 minute. If the creature is airborne, it descends at 60 ft per round until it reaches the ground or the effect ends.

If the target succeeds on a save against this blessing, it takes 1d4 force damage for each Devotion you spent.

</div>

### Channel Divinity
You know the following Channel Divinity options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Earthbind
    Each target is affected as if you had used the Earthbind Smite on it. You can spend additional Devotion when channeling.

- #### Live to See the Skies Again
    As a ***bonus action*** you let out a warning cry to alert your allies to pending doom and ensure that your flock can escape danger. Each creature of your choice within 30 ft that can hear you can immediately move up to their movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

</div>

### Aura of Aviation
Creatures of your choice within 10 ft have the benefits of your Gliding feature.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

### Strengthening the Divine
You gain access to the following.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Divine Blessings
    This blessing can only be used on yourself, and requires you to spend at least 3 Devotion.

    ***Bird Form***. You transform into a raven, but keep your mental ability scores. You are limited in the actions you can perform by the nature of the new form, so you can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. Your gear melds into the new form, meaning you can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of your equipment.

    When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before the transformation. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the normal form.

- #### Kenku Can Too
    You can elevate your talent for mimicking to new heights. As a ***reaction*** to a creature casting a spell with verbal components, you can temporarily imprint it to your short-term memory. Until the end of your next turn, you can spend Devotion equal to the spell level, to cast that spell without material components, but otherwise using the regular spellcasting rules.

</div>

### Noisy Feathers
Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effect of a ***feather fall*** spell.

Additionally, you can make sounds even if you are silenced.

### True To Your Heart
You can use an ***action*** and spend 5 Devotion to assume the form of what your heart is telling you that your race once was. For 10 minutes, you gain the following benefits:

- Your size becomes Large.
- You gain a flying speed equal to double your normal movement speed.
- Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit, you deal slashing damage equal to 3d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and you can choose to grapple the target. A creature grappled in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your Strength of devotion save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and you can't use your talons on another target.
