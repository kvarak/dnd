# Fighter


>*"We're not all just weapons and armor, you know. Some of us have other talents. Sure, they all result in someone getting hurt really, really bad, but you've got to have a little variety every now and then."*
>
>— Janus Sironan, knight commander

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

## Character Creation
Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter’s motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.

Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there’s gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.

The sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.

### Heraldic Sign
Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one’s self-interest.

Your character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that’s not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.

##### Heraldic Signs

| d6 | Sign |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | A rampant golden dragon on a green field, representing valor and a quest for wealth. |
| 2 | The fist of a storm giant clutching lightning before a storm cloud, symbolizing wrath and power. |
| 3 | Crossed greatswords in front of a castle gate, signifying the defense of a city or kingdom. |
| 4 | A skull with a dagger through it, representing the doom you bring to your enemies. |
| 5 | A phoenix in a ring of fire, an expression of an indomitable spirit. |
| 6 | Three drops of blood beneath a horizontal sword blade on a black background, symbolizing three foes you have sworn to kill. |

### Instructor
Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group. A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student’s background.

If you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person’s specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor’s teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?


##### Instructors

| d6 | Instructor |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | Gladiator. Your instructor was a slave who fought for freedom in the arena, or one who willingly chose the gladiator’s life to earn money and fame. |
| 2 | Military. Your trainer served with a group of soldiers and knows much about working as a team. |
| 3 | City Watch. Crowd control and peacekeeping are your instructor’s specialties. |
| 4 | Tribal Warrior. Your instructor grew up in a tribe, where fighting for one’s life was practically an everyday occurrence. |
| 5 | Street Fighter. Your trainer excels at urban combat, combining close-quarters work with silence and efficiency. |
| 6 | Weapon Master. Your mentor helped you to become one with your chosen weapon, by imparting highly specialized knowledge of how to wield it most effectively. |

### Signature Style
Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter’s personality, that’s not always the case — someone’s approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.

Do you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?

##### Signature Styles

| d6 | Style |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | Elegant. You move with precise grace and total control, never using more energy than you need. |
| 2 | Brutal. Your attacks rain down like hammer blows, meant to splinter bone or send blood flying. |
| 3 | Cunning. You dart in to attack at just the right moment and use small-scale tactics to tilt the odds in your favor. |
| 4 | Effortless. You rarely perspire or display anything other than a stoic expression in battle. |
| 5 | Energetic. You sing and laugh during combat as your spirit soars. You are happiest when you have a foe in front of you and a weapon in hand. |
| 6 | Sinister. You scowl and sneer while fighting, and you enjoy mocking your foes as you defeat them. |


### Class Training
Why did you choose the path of a fighter. In the following table are some suggestions, but keep in mind your background and all the other details you have established so far.

##### Fighter Background

| d6 | I became a fighter because … |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | I wanted to hone my combat skills, and so I joined a war college. |
| 2 | I squired for a knight who taught me how to fight, care for a steed, and conduct myself with honor. I decided to take up that path for myself. |
| 3 | Horrible monsters descended on my community, killing someone I loved. I took up arms to destroy those creatures and others of a similar nature. |
| 4 | I joined the army and learned how to fight as part of a group. |
| 5 | I grew up fighting, and I refined my talents by defending myself against people who crossed me. |
| 6 | I could always pick up just about any weapon and know how to use it effectively. |

### Fighting Styles
At 1st level, a fighter adopts a particular style of fighting as his specialty. All styles are listed *<a href="#internal-FightingStyles">here</a>*.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Second Wind
From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain a number of hit points based on your fighter level.

| Level | Hit Points |
|:-----:|:-----------|
| 1st | 1d10 + fighter level
| 3rd | 2d10 + fighter level
| 7th | 3d10 + fighter level
| 10th | 4d10 + fighter level
| 15th | 5d10 + fighter level
| 18th | 6d10 + fighter level

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a  rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.



### Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. All are detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.


### Indomitable
At 9th level, select either the Indomitable self or Indomitable ally feature.

When you use the feature you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times starting at 17th level.

#### Indomitable Self
You can reroll a saving throw that you fail.

#### Indomitable Ally
Your courageous words inspire valor and ferocity in your allies, allowing you to use your reaction to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see or hear you to reroll a failed saving throw.

##### Arcane Archer Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-:|:--|
| 3rd | Arcane Archer Lore, Arcane Shot (2 options) |
| 7th | Curving Shot, Magic Arrow, Arcane Shot (3 options) |
| 10th | Arcane Shot (4 options) |
| 15th | Ever-Ready Shot, Arcane Shot (5 options) |
| 18th | Arcane Shot (6 options, improved shots) |

</div>

An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.


#### Arcane Archer Lore
At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature — typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the *prestidigitation* or the *druidcraft* cantrip.

#### Arcane Shot
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see “Arcane Shot Options” below).

Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

#### Magic Arrow
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.

#### Curving Shot
At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

#### Ever-Ready Shot
Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.

### Arcane Shot Options
The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Banishing Arrow**. You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target’s speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

    After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.

- **Beguiling Arrow**. Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

    The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Bursting Arrow**. You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.

    The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Enfeebling Arrow**. You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

    The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Grasping Arrow**. When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

    The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Piercing Arrow**. You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

    The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Seeking Arrow**. Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it  can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.

    The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- **Shadow Arrow**. You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

    The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-BattleMaster">Battle Master</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

##### Battle Master Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Combat Superiority, Student of War
| 7th | Combat Superiority (+2 maneuvers, +1 die), Know Your Enemy
| 10th | Combat Superiority (+2 maneuvers), Improved Combat Superiority (d10)
| 15th | Combat Superiority (+2 maneuvers, +1 die), Relentless
| 18th | Improved Combat Superiority (d12)

</div>

Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.


#### Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers**. You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice**. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws**. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

* Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

#### Student of War
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### Know Your Enemy
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
```
```
* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels (if any)
* Fighter class levels (if any)

#### Improved Combat Superiority
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into dl2s.

#### Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
**Ambush**. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Athletic Prowess**. When you move, you can expend one superiority die, adding it to any Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity ability checks you make until you stop moving.

**Bait and Switch**. When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Commander's Strike**. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Combat Focus**. As a reaction, you can spend a Superiority Die and add that number to a save. You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result.

**Defensive Shove**. As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to shove an adjacent friendly creature out of harm's way. It moves 10 feet in the direction of your choice, and until the start of your next turn, it can add the superiority die to either its AC or a save the next time it is targeted by an attack or spell.

**Disarming Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet. If you are adjacent to the target and have a free hand, you may catch the disarmed item.

**Distracting Strike**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


**Expert Deflection**. (*Prerequisite: 10th level*) Reduce the damage from an attack that hits you or an ally within 5 feet by two superiority dice worth. You must spend two superiority dice to use this maneuver.

**Evasive Footwork**. When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

This maneuver also allows you to dodge an attack with some evasive, reactive footwork. When another creature attacks you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and roll it — add the number to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

**Feinting Attack**. You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Goading Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

**Immortal Fortitude**. If you would be reduced to 0 or less Hit Points after receiving damage, you can as a reaction spend a Superiority Die to roll a Constitution Save against a DC of half the damage dealt against you or DC 15, whichever is higher, to survive the attack and remain at 1 Hit Point.

**Inner Calm**. When you make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, you can expend one superiority die to add the result to your roll.

**Living Shield**. When an adjacent friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction. The damage the friendly creature takes is reduced by twice the superiority die result, and you take half that damage.

**Lunging Attack**. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach with melee weapon attacks by 5 ft until the end of your turn.

Once during your turn, if you hit a creature with a lunging attack, you may add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Maneuvering Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

**Menacing Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Overwhelming Mountain Strikes**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend one superiority die to add to the damage roll of the attack. In addition, the creature struck must make a Strength save or have their movement reduced to until the end of their next turn. If a second strike is made on the same target during the same turn by you after failing the Strength Save, the creature also loses their bonus action, and if a third strike is successful, they lose their reaction as well.

**Parry**. When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

**Perimeter Scan**. You can expend a superiority die as a bonus action to make a Perception roll, adding the superiority die to the result. Until the start of your next turn, can also add the superiority die to the next damage roll you make against a creature you detect in this way.

**Powerful Swing**. (*Prerequisite: 10th level*) Gives disadvantage on the attack roll, but adds double the superiority dice to damage.

**Precision Attack**. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

**Pushing Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back.

# <a name="internal-Brute">Brute</a>
The battlefield attracts fighters of all types and creeds. Inevitably, each fighter will do his damnedest to prove to the others that his way is the "right" way of fighting: the Champion sculpts his body into a figure made of marble, the Battle Master uses tricks and tactics to control the flow of combat, and the Eldritch Knights straight-up cheat by bringing magic into the whole mess. Kensai, Duelists and Weapon masters of all types, they all think they know how to win.

The real answer is much, much more simple: Pick up the biggest, heaviest thing you can find, and squash the rest of them with it.

That's the Brute Way.

##### Brute Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Fearsome Brute, Heavy Metal
| 7th | Beast of Burden
| 10th | Hulking Hurler
| 15th | Musclebound Enforcer
| 18th | Combat Brute

#### Fearsome Brute
Beginning at 3rd level, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) made against humanoids that are your size or smaller.

#### Heavy Metal
Starting at 3rd level, the Brute learns how to make the most out of the biggest, heaviest weapons. When wielding a weapon with the Heavy trait, he deals an additional 1d4 damage per strike. This increases to 1d6 at 10th level and 1d8 at 18th level.

In addition, you can use your bonus action to dealt an additional 1d4 of weapon damage on a successful hit with a heavy weapon and force the target to succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be shoved 5 feet away for every 10 points of damage dealt by this attack. Creatures of Huge size or larger automatically succeed on the saving throw from this feature. The extra damage from this feature increases to 1d6 at 7th level, 1d8 at 11th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.

```
```

#### Beast of Burden
Brutes are adept at lugging lots of heavy gear and how to effectively throw their weight around. Starting at 7th level, you double your capacities for carrying, lifting, pushing, and pulling, and gain advantage on noncombat strength checks.

#### Hulking Hurler
Tossing big, heavy things at an enemy is always a useful tactic. At 10th level you can treat any weapon with the Heavy descriptor and any sufficiently large improvised weapon as if it had the Thrown Property, with a range of 20/60 feet, and you gain proficiency with thrown improvised weapons.

#### Musclebound Enforcer
Violence never solves anything. The visible threat of violence, however will get you very far. At 15th level you add your Strength bonus in addition to your Charisma bonus to all Intimidation checks.

#### Combat Brute
From 18th level, after shoving a target, you gain advantage on your next attack against that target. Also, after you hit using an attack action with a Heavy melee weapon, you may choose to forgo any number of additional attacks you get from the Extra Attack feature. For each attack you forego, you add two extra weapon damage dice to your damage roll.

# <a name="internal-bulwark">Bulwark</a>
Fighters of great renown are often associated with particular places, taking titles and honorifics from battlefields where they won decisive military victories, the lands they have conquered, or cities they have defended. Bulwark is a title bestowed upon a fighter - by a town, a city, or a group of people - who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in their protection. Bulwarks are defensive giants, using sword, javelin and shield in equal measure to ward away blows while offering tactical advantage to their allies.

##### Bulwark Features

|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Mighty Throw, Tower Shield

| 10th | Mobile Cover
| 15th | Immovable Object
| 18th | Aristeia

#### Mighty Throw
Beginning at 3rd level, you can add your brutal power to your attacks with thrown weapons. You gain the following benefits while making a ranged weapon attack with a weapon that has the thrown property:
* You can double the normal and longe ranges of weapons with the thrown property.
* Before you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the thrown property that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

#### Tower Shield
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your mastery over your shield allows you to use it protect your allies as well as yourself. You can confer three-quarters cover to one willing creature within 5 feet of you. This cover is ignored by enemies who are within 5 feet of the creature to whom you are conferring cover.

```
```

#### Steadying Influence
Beginning at 7th level, you emanate an aura of confidence. Any creature to which you are conferring cover can make the first ranged spell or weapon attack roll on each of its turns with advantage.

#### Mobile Cover
Beginning at 10th level, you can coordinate your movement with your allies as you shield them from attacks. Whenever a creature to which you are conferring cover moves on their turn, you can use your reaction to move with them, up to a maximum distance equal to half your speed.

#### Immovable Object
Beginning at 15th level, you cannot be shoved or knocked prone.

#### Aristeia
Beginning at 18th level, you can mark a moment in time as an opportunity to display your excellence in battle. You can activate this feature using an action. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
* You and any creature to which you are conferring cover gain temporary hit points equal to your Strength modifier at the beginning of each of your turns.
* You gain advantage on all attack rolls made against a creature that has taken damage from a creature to which you confer cover in the previous round.
* Once per turn, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage done by one of your thrown weapon attacks.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

# <a name="internal-EldritchKnight">Eldritch Knight</a>
The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

##### Eldritch Knight Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Spellcasting, Weapon Bond
| 7th | War Magic
| 10th | Eldritch Strike
| 15th | Arcane Charge
| 18th | Improved War Magic

#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

**Cantrips**. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots**. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher**. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

```

</div>

#### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

#### War Magic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

#### Eldritch Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit   a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>



#### Arcane Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

```
```

#### Improved War Magic
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

# <a name="internal-ghostOperative">Ghost Operative</a>

*"Get in, do the job, get out. If they're lucky, they won't know I'm there. If not, they'll wish I wasn't."*

-- Gregor Antus, of the 1st Scouting Regiment

Ghost Operatives are the elite scouts and strike force of a well-trained military unit. They combine the skills of a spy with combat prowess, quickly moving through the battlefield even while heavily armored, and they are deadly when they catch an opponent unawares. These fighters excel at stealth, undercover operations, and infiltration of enemy installations. If a Ghost Operative does their job right, their adversaries won't know they were there at all.

##### Ghost Operative Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Bonus Proficiency, Covert Ops
| 7th | Initiative Bonus, Reconnaissance
| 10th | Extraction
| 15th | Infiltration
| 18th | Sudden Strike

#### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. If you already had this proficiency, you may choose another skill from the fighter skill list.

#### Covert Ops
Also starting at 3rd level, medium and heavy armor does not impose disadvantage on Stealth checks for you.

#### Initiative Bonus
From 7th level, you are always prepared to move quickly if something goes wrong and fighting begins. You and allied creatures within 20 feet of you who can see you add your proficiency bonus to their initiative rolls.

```
```

#### Reconnaissance
Also from 7th level, your training to better able to find the information you need in order to complete your mission has improved even more. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while you are indoors.

#### Extraction
Starting at 10th level, you can quickly and effectively help your allies remove themselves from dicey situations. As a bonus action on your turn you can assist a creature within 5 feet of you to escape from its current position. That creature can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Infiltration
At 15th level, you have learned tricks to help you enter and move about target sites quietly. You gain the following benefits:
You have advantage on ability checks made to detect or disarm traps.
You have advantage on saving throws against traps.
You don't activate traps or spells that would be activated by stepping on them.

#### Sudden Strike
At 18th level, you can quickly neutralize a target if you can get the drop on them. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. If the target’s remaining hp is less than twice your fighter level, you can choose to knock them out instead. If you do, you deal no damage, but the creature falls unconscious.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


# <a name="internal-kindler">Kindler</a>
Kindlers are fighters who choose to bear a torch for others, a symbolic flame which signifies guidance, protection, and life. While to many, fire might be seen as something with no more purpose than to kill and destroy, a kindler wields its heat similarly to how another might hold a shield, though they are no stranger to using fire for offensive purposes as well.

##### Kindler Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd	| Torchbearer, Living Flame (2 uses)
| 7th	| Resting Bonfire
| 10th	| Inspiring Spark, Living Flame (3 uses)
| 15th	| Brilliant Flare
| 18th	| Eternal Ember

#### Torchbearer
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to wield torches as weapons. A lit torch becomes a melee weapon dealing 2d4 fire damage with the light property for you.

#### Living Flame
Also, at 3rd level, you can temper your inner flame, and release it as a bonus action if you are wielding a torch. When you do so, for the next minute, whenever you hit a creature with a lit torch, you can use your bonus action to inflict one of the following conditions on the creature.

**Branding Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or be branded by you for the duration of your Living Flame. While the creature is branded, it takes 2d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Cauterizing Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be unable to regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

**Sinister Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

The effect ends early if you either choose to end it (no action required), if you let go of your torch, or if your torch is extinguished. The DC for these saving throws is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

You can use this feature twice, and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest. When you reach 10th level, you gain a third use of this feature.
```
```
#### Resting Bonfire
At 7th level, you can conjure up a calming fire during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures regains additional hit points equal to 1d4 + half of your fighter level (rounded up).

#### Inspiring Spark
Beginning at 10th level, your Living Flame feature inspires confidence in your allies. While a creature is within 20 feet of you while you are using your Living Flame, it cannot be frightened.

#### Brilliant Flare
Starting at 15th level, the flames that live inside of you burst out when you push yourself to your limits. When you use your Action Surge, all creatures of your choice that can see you within 20 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, or be blinded until the start of your next turn.

#### Eternal Ember
By 18th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Living Flame remaining, you regain one use of it.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>


# <a name="internal-runeguard">Runeguard</a>
The runeguard seeks the magical power within ancient languages, and to hasten the speed of their blade and strengthen of their armor by imbuing them with the power of these runes.

##### Runeguard Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Master Runes, Runecraft, Runescript
| 7th | Eyes of the Arcanist
| 10th | Sentinel’s Reckoning
| 15th | Sentinel’s Reckoning (2)
| 18th | Runic Mastery

#### Master Runes
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn five master runes; *Ild* (fire), *Kalt* (frost), *Ond* (spirit), *Stein* (Stone), and *Vind* (wind). While these names are known to you as the basis for empowering your equipment, their application continues to require diligent study, constant trial, and repeated error to evoke the unique properties from each variant invocation.

#### Runecraft
At 3rd level, you learn augmentations that utilize the master runes to enhance your martial prowess. Their effects are based on how you invoke them, generating defensive properties to thwart your foes’ advance or deal decisive blows.

**Ritual Crafting**. Each runic combination must be inscribed and empowered into your equipment over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest. Each piece of equipment must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse a part of your being into the runes, causing them to glow slightly with your own spiritual essence. The rune’s power fades if it moves more than 100 feet away from you and can’t be used by anyone other than you.

**Runic Augmentations**. You learn three runic augmentations of your choice, which are detailed under “Runic Augmentations” below. Each augmentation is specific to its master rune; for instance, if you learn the Sokn augmentation of the Ild master rune, you don’t gain the ability to use the Sokn augmentation with other master runes unless you also learn that specific combination.

Once you activate one of your runic augmentations, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You learn two additional augmentations at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new augmentations, you can choose to replace one you already know with a different one.

```
```

**Augmentation Activation**. During your turn, you can activate a single runic augmentation by focusing on the rune’s power. You can activate one of these augmentations on your turn using your bonus action to empower your attacks (Sokn), your reaction to entrench your defenses (Vard) or skillfully enhance another ability (Hagr) with your action.

Activating a rune requires concentration, which lasts a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (minimum 3). While you concentrate on a rune, you can cast spells but you can't concentrate on a rune and a spell at the same time. You gain the ability to concentrate on two runes at once at 10th level.

**Saving Throws**. Some of your runic augmentations require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

- **Runic save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Runescript
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana and Religion skills. Additionally, you double your proficiency bonus when making Intelligence checks that involve identifying magical writing, such as arcane sigils or divine text.

#### Eyes of the Arcanist
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing the flow of magic in the immediate area, you can detect familiar patterns in the weave. The DM tells you the general location of magic writing used in rite or ritual within 60 feet of you, whether active or dormant, and you know the type (arcane, divine, or otherwise) of any script you sense but not its exact purpose or power. You can use this feature a number of times a day equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Sentinel’s Reckoning
Beginning at 10th level, you can unleash the energy of your runes to devastating effect by shouting the command word Tal as an action (see “Tal” under Runic Augmentations). Choose one Tal effect from the runes you have active, and all active augmentations go dormant until you finish a short or long rest. You can still use other augmentations you have yet to activate. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Starting at 15th level, you can use this feature twice before a rest, but only once per turn.

#### Runic Mastery
At 18th level, you can have three runes activate and you no longer need to concentrate on your runic augmentations.



### Runic Augmentations
Below are the runic augmentations for each of the five master runes. In the ancient tongues, the augmentation can be said before or after the rune.

#### Sokn
*Attack Augmentation*

You can activate a rune with the Sokn augmentation as a bonus action. A rune’s power only affects the weapon it is inscribed on.
* **Ild**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you ignite the target. At the start of each of the burning creature's turns, it takes 1d4 fire damage for each time you've burned it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such burns on itself on a success. Alternatively, the burned creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your runic save DC, ending the effect of all burns on it on a success.
* **Kalt**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
* **Ond**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage and you recover hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
* **Stein**. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a weapon attack, it must make a Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.
* **Vind**. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### Vard
*Defense Augmentation*

You can activate a rune with the Vard augmentation as a reaction. A rune’s power can only be used while wearing the armor or holding the shield it is inscribed on.
* **Ild**. When you are hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
* **Kalt**. When you are hit by a melee attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
* **Ond**. You gain a bonus to saving throws made to resist being frightened equal to your Constitution modifier.
* **Stein**. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist being moved against your will.
* **Vind**. Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage as wind whips around you.

```
```
#### Hagr
*Ability Augmentation*

You can activate a rune with the Hagr augmentation as an action. This rune must be inscribed on your body to be activated.
* **Ild**. You can add your Constitution modifier to your Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) ability checks.
* **Kalt**. You ignore difficult terrain and can walk safely across still or gently moving water.
* **Ond**. When you receive healing from any source, you also gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your proficiency bonus.
* **Stein**. You have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.
* **Vind**. Your movement speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Constitution modifier (minimum 5 feet).

#### Tal
*Reckoning*

Once you gain the Sentinel’s Reckoning feature at 10th level, you can activate a rune with the Tal command word as an action. This rune manifests in the air around you when activated.
* **Ild**. Each creature within a 5-foot-radius of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to 2d6 × the number of runes you have active on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* **Kalt**. An eruption of magical frost blasts from you in a radius equal to 10 feet × the number of runes you have active. All creatures of your choice within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for a number of rounds equal to the number of active runes. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw to break free.
* **Ond**. Life spirits swirl about you in a 5-foot-radius. All creatures of your choice within that radius regain hit points equal to 1d6 × the number of runes you have active.
* **Stein**. You release your runic power in an arc before you, creating a cone of difficult terrain as jagged earth erupts equal to 5 feet × the number of runes you have active. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d4 slashing damage.
* **Vind**. A furious cyclone whips up a strong wind around you. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius must succeed a Strength saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage, be pushed a number of feet equal to 5 × the number of runes you have active (minimum of 5 feet), and fall prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

# <a name="internal-Skirmisher">Skirmisher / Mariner</a>
The skirmisher is a warrior trained for speed. They use their superior mobility to take the fight to their opponents and keep them off balance. A fighter built for maneuverability from an aquatic setting is called a mariner and follows the same rules (but choosing the swimming option for No Escape at 3rd level).

##### Skirmisher Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | No Escape
| 7th | Leaping Attack
| 10th | Evasion
| 15th | Flow like Water
| 18th | Whirlwind attack

#### No Escape
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you may use your reaction to move up to half your speed when a creature you can see that is hostile to you moves. In addition, you suffer no penalty to movement while either swimming or climbing (chosen when this archetype is taken).

```
```
#### Leaping Attack
At 7th level, when you move at least 10 feet prior to attacking, you have Advantage on attack rolls.

#### Evasion
At 10th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Flow like Water
At 18th level, your base speed increases by 10 feet and you become proficient in Dexterity saving throws.

#### Whirlwind attack
Starting at 18th level, when you use your Action Surge, you may make an attack action against every enemy within your reach. This ability overrides your Extra Attack ability. Each enemy within your reach can only be attacked once.

# <a name="internal-Templar">Templar</a>
Throughout history, myth, and fiction, warriors have often had a religious focus. The cult of Ares, the Norse úlfheðnar, the cult of Mithras and of course the Templars are all examples of this. The Templar is a fighter archetype that parallels the Eldritch Knight - using magic similar to clerics rather than wizards. Their focus remains firmly martial - their magical powers are much more limited than clerics, or even paladins. This version of the religious warrior is one of a cult member initiated into secrets. The Templars gain their powers as much from the study of ritual and cult secrets as from a divine power.

##### Templar Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Learned, Spellcasting
| 7th | Domain lore
| 10th | Ritual magic
| 15th | Additional domain lore
| 18th | Ritual master

#### Learned
Though the study of cult lore, you become proficient in a single intelligence-based skill other than investigation at 3rd level. While religion is the most common topic a Templar might gain, each cult and each member focus on different lore.

#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain divinely inspired magical ability. Your spells come from the cleric list.

**Cantrips**. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots**. The Templar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher**. You know one 1st-level cleric spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Templar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

In addition, pick a cleric domain. You know all 1st level spells of that domain. At level 7 you learn all 2nd level spells of your domain, at 13th level the 3rd level spells and at 19th level the 4th level spells.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. However, you may not swap out a domain spell. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier

```
```

</div>
#### Domain lore
At 7th level, you gain the domain abilities of a 1st level cleric of the domain you selected at 3rd level. If heavy armor or martial weapons are part of what would be gained, you instead gain proficiency in another intelligence-based skill other than investigation. If the ability mentions "cleric level", use your fighter level divided by 3.

#### Ritual magic
At 10th level you may learn 2 cleric rituals of level 2 or lower. Unless those are spells you otherwise know, you may not cast them as anything other than rituals. At 15th level you gain an additional cleric ritual which must be of 3rd level or lower. At 20th level you learn a final ritual and it may be up to a level 4 cleric spell.

#### Additional domain lore
At 15th level you gain the 2nd level domain ability of your domain. If the ability mentions "cleric level", use your fighter level divided by 3 instead. If that ability involves channel divinity, you have one use of channel divinity which is regained after a short or long rest.

#### Ritual master
At level 18 you gain the ability to cast any ritual you learned though this archetype as an action (rather than the 10 minutes typically used). You may only use this power once between long rests.

# <a name="internal-FightingStyles">Fighting Styles</a>
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.


#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Battle Vigor
At the start of combat when initiative is rolled you gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.

#### Blind Fighting
Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your melee attack rolls against it.

#### Brawler
Your unarmed strikes gain a +1 to hit, and deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage for an unarmed strike. This increases to 1d6 at level 8 and 1d8 at level 16. You may treat your fists as two weapons for all appropriate actions, benefits, and feats.

If you have the Brawler feat, you also gain the following option:

**Counterpunch**. If you take the dodge action, and a creature misses a melee attack against you, you may use your reaction to make a single unarmed or improvised weapon strike against that creature. You must not be wielding any other weapons, and not be wearing a shield to perform a counterpunch.

#### Cavalry
Whenever you are mounted, you may add your proficiency bonus to the saving throws and AC of your steed. In addition you have advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

When you are mounted, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a large or smaller creature you may use your action to make a charging attack. If the attack hits, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. The DC for the save is equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency + bonus.

#### Charge Leader
When you roll initiative, all allies who can see or hear you gain advantage on their initiative roll so long as you are not surprised.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are fighting with a melee weapon in one hand and not using a weapon or shield in the other, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Fortification
You are adept at protecting your vital areas with your shield. You can use you reaction to turn a critical hit you are aware of into a regular hit.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield.

#### Opportunist
While wielding a melee weapon in one hand and nothing in the other, you gain advantage on attack rolls made using a reaction.

#### Mariner
As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Master Thrower
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Versatile Style
If you are wielding a versatile weapon in one hand, you gain +1 to attack rolls. While you are wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain +1 to AC.
