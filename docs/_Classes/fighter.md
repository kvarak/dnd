# Fighter

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.


> *"We're not all just weapons and armor, you know. Some of us have other talents. Sure, they all result in someone getting hurt really, really bad, but you've got to have a little variety every now and then."*
>
> — Janus Sironan, knight commander

#### Well-Rounded Specialists
Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor.

Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.



#### Trained for Danger
Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge.

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.

#### Mission Accomplished
Whether your intention is to end a target's threat or simply deliver a message (violently or otherwise), those around you can take comfort in knowing that when you take on a job, the job gets done. When your party loses its direction or collective nerve, you stand taJI with the power of your convictions and an even more powerful assortment of weapons to keep things on track.

It might seem ridiculous to say that your weapon, armor, or shield is your best friend and most stalwart companion- but you'll take that risk. If you had to choose between entering a battle without your favorite combat gear or without the party's bard, Singy McLuteface can sit this one out. You and your equipment have got this.

Your signature equipment is more than tools that have never let you down. It lets others know who you are on the battlefield. Even when your features are obscured by the blood of the fallen, the dust of a well trodden arena, or the fog of war, allies and enemies alike take notice when you stalk the battlefield.

### Fighter Quirks
When the battle is done, enemies and allies alike stare in awe at the sight of your personal ritual of celebration.


#### Victory Celebration
| d10 | Celebration |
|:---:|:------------|
| 1 | A finely honed, well-choreographed dance
| 2 | Ale! And then more ale!
| 3 | Seizing a trophy from a vanquished foe
| 4 | Composing a poem extolling your valiant combat prowess
| S | Adding a commemorative square to your battle quilt
| 6 | Adding a decorative stencil to your favorite weapon or armor
| 7 | Paying the town crier to proclaim your victory
| 8 | Commissioning a painting of the battle
| 9 | Praising surviving enemies for a job well done, no hard feelings
| 10 | There is no time to celebrate, for your war is eternal!



## Class Features
As a fighter, you gain the following class features.

### Fighter Origin
The type of martial training you received sets the groundwork for your career as a fighter. Your origin can range from a disciplined training in the army, to being a self-taught farmer.

All origins are describes at the end of the class description. Select the origin most suitable for your character.

### Fighting Styles
At 1st level, a fighter adopts a particular style of fighting as his specialty. All styles are listed *<a href="#internal-FightingStyles">here</a>*.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Second Wind
From 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, if you have less than half your hp left, you can use a ***bonus action*** to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your Constitution bonus.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.

### Combat Superiority
Starting at 2nd level, your tactical expertise makes you a deadly force on the battlefield. You learn maneuvers which are fueled by a special resource called superiority.

#### Maneuvers
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, and one decided by your fighter background. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn additional maneuvers at certain levels as shown in the Maneuvers Known section of the Fighter table.




Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. All maneuvers are listed *<a href="#internal-combatManeuvers">here</a>*.

In addition you always have access to the ***Action Surge*** maneuver (see below)

#### Superiority
To use a maneuver, you have to spend ***Superiority***. Most maneuvers require you to spend 2 superiority, some cost only 1, and the action surge maneuver costs 4. The amount of superiority you have per level as shown in the Fighter table.

#### Superiority Dice
Some maneuvers have effects based on your superiority die. You start with a d6, and it increases as you level, as shown in the Fighter table.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

#### Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can spend ***4 superiority*** to take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

### Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. All are detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Indomitable
At 9th level, you can choose either *Indomitable self* or *Indomitable ally*.




When you use the feature you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times starting at 17th level.

#### Indomitable Self
As a ***reaction***, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.

#### Indomitable Ally
Your courageous words inspire valor and ferocity in your allies, allowing you to use your ***reaction*** to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see or hear you to reroll a failed saving throw.

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Boltslinger, The Future of Warfare
| 7th | Snap Shot
| 10th | Bull's Eye
| 15th | Critical Bolt
| 18th | Ordnance

</div>

As an arbalestion, you often believe that melee combat is a thing of the past. A modern thinker; you apply your knowledge of enginering to master the use of the more sophisticated crossbows to a deadly effect.


### Boltslinger
You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls made with any type of crossbow.

### The Future of Warfare
You become proficient with Tinker's tools and Fletcher’s tools. If already proficient, you instead gain advantage on all checks using these tools.

During a day of work, you can try to modify an existing crossbow into a repeating crossbow. This is a DC 20 Intelligence check using your Tinker's tools. If you fail, you can repeat this check the next day, with the DC reduced by 2. This reduction is cumulative.

A repeating crossbow has the statistics of the base crossbow, but adds 2 lbs to its weight, and has a magazine that holds up to 12 bolts at once and doesn't require any sort of action to reload between attacks. Changing an empty magazine requires an action.

- You can make a Intelligence ability check using your Tinker's tools against DC 12 to make a magazine for your repeating crossbow during a long rest.
- You can make a Intelligence ability check using your Tinker's tools against DC 10 to fill 2 magazines during an hour, or 4 during a long rest. On a failed check, you only prepare 1.
- You can make a Intelligence ability check using your Fletcher’s tools against DC 10 to make 1d6 crossbow bolts during an hour, or 4d6 during a long rest. On a failed check, you only create 1d4-1 crossbow bolts.



### Snap Shot
When a creature misses you with an attack, you can make a single ranged weapon attack as a ***reaction***, provided you have sufficient ammunition. You may spend 1 superiority point to gain advantage on this attack.

### Bull’s Eye
You gain the Sharpshooter feat. If you have that feat already, you may select a different feat.

### Critical Bolt
Attacks you make with crossbows score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.

### Ordnance
At 18th level, you can turn a regular crossbow bolt into a deadly explosive. This process consumes material components worth at least 500 gp, such as a ruby, dragon scales or the heart of a fire giant that explodes in a large area on impact. You can craft one of these bolts during a long rest by making a DC 15 Intelligence check with your Fletcher’s Tools.

As an ***action***, you can choose one creature or object with range and within your line of sight and fire your ordnance bolt. That creature or object and all creatures in a 40 foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier with the original target having disadvantage on the saving throw. All creatures take 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects take double damage from this attack.

</div>

An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.


### Arcane Archer Lore
At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature — typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the *prestidigitation* or the *druidcraft* cantrip.

### Arcane Shot
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see “*Arcane Shot Options*” below).

When you fire an arrow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

### Magic Arrow
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.



### Curving Shot
At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a ***bonus action*** to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

### Ever-Ready Shot
Starting at 15th level, you are always ready with an Arcane Shot. When you roll initiative, you can use a one of your Arcane Shot maneuvers as part of the first ranged weapon attack you make, without expending a use of Arcane shot.

## Arcane Shot Options
The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Banishing Arrow
    You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target’s speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

    After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.

- #### Beguiling Arrow
    Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or gain the charmed condition until the start of your next turn.

    The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Bursting Arrow
    You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.

    The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Enfeebling Arrow
    You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

    The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Grasping Arrow
    When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

    The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Piercing Arrow
    You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a 30 feet line before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

    The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Seeking Arrow
    Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover.

    If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can.

    On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.

    The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

- #### Shadow Arrow
    You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

    The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-Brute">Brute</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Brute Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Fearsome Brute, Heavy Metal
| 7th | Beast of Burden
| 10th | Hulking Hurler
| 15th | Musclebound Enforcer
| 18th | Combat Brute

</div>

The battlefield attracts fighters of all types and creeds. Inevitably, each fighter will do his damnedest to prove to the others that his way is the "right" way of fighting: the Champion sculpts his body into a figure made of marble, the Battle Master uses tricks and tactics to control the flow of combat, and the Eldritch Knights straight-up cheat by bringing magic into the whole mess. Kensai, Duelists and Weapon masters of all types, they all think they know how to win.

The real answer is much, much more simple: Pick up the biggest, heaviest thing you can find, and squash the rest of them with it.

That's the Brute Way.




### Fearsome Brute
Beginning at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill and always have advantage on such checks. In addition you can use Strength when intimidating a creature of your size or smaller.

### Heavy Metal
Starting at 3rd level, the Brute learns how to make the most out of the biggest, heaviest weapons. When wielding a weapon with the Heavy trait, you deal an additional 1d4 damage per strike. This increases to 1d6 at 10th level and 1d8 at 18th level.

In addition, you can use your ***bonus action*** to deal an additional 1d4 of weapon damage on a successful hit with a heavy weapon and force the target to succeed on a Strength saving throw against 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, or be shoved 5 feet away for every 10 points of damage dealt by this attack. Creatures of Huge size or larger automatically succeed on the saving throw from this feature.

The extra damage from this feature increases to 1d6 at 7th level, 1d8 at 11th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.



### Beast of Burden
Brutes are adept at lugging lots of heavy gear and how to effectively throw their weight around. Starting at 7th level, you double your capacities for carrying, lifting, pushing, and pulling, and gain advantage on noncombat strength checks.

### Hulking Hurler
Tossing big, heavy things at an enemy is always a useful tactic. At 10th level you can treat any weapon with the Heavy descriptor and any sufficiently large improvised weapon as if it had the Thrown Property, with a range of 20/60 feet, and you gain proficiency with thrown improvised weapons.

### Musclebound Enforcer
Violence never solves anything. The visible threat of violence, however will get you very far. At 15th level you have expertise with the Intimidation skill.

### Combat Brute
From 18th level, after shoving a target, you gain advantage on your next attack against that target. Also, after you hit using an attack action with a Heavy melee weapon, you may choose to forgo any number of additional attacks you get from the Extra Attack feature. For each attack you forego, you add two extra weapon damage dice to your damage roll.

Bulwarks are elite defensive warriors whose strengths shine while fighting side by side with their allies.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.


### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

#### Cantrips
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots
The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a ***bonus action*** on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

### War Magic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a ***bonus action***.

### Eldritch Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit  a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

### Arcane Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

### Improved War Magic
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a ***bonus action***.

| 3rd | Bonus Proficiency, Covert Ops
| 7th | Initiative Bonus, Reconnaissance
| 10th | Extraction
| 15th | Infiltration
| 18th | Sudden Strike


</div>

Ghost Operatives are the elite scouts and strike force of a well-trained military unit. They combine the skills of a spy with combat prowess, quickly moving through the battlefield even while heavily armored, and they are deadly when they catch an opponent unawares. These fighters excel at stealth, undercover operations, and infiltration of enemy installations. If a Ghost Operative does their job right, their adversaries won't know they were there at all.


> *"Get in, do the job, get out. If they're lucky, they won't know I'm there. If not, they'll wish I wasn't."*
>
> -- Gregor Antus, of the 1st Scouting Regiment


### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Investigation, Perception and Stealth skills. In addition you always have advantage on ability checks made using Stealth.

### Covert Ops
Also starting at 3rd level, medium and heavy armor does not impose disadvantage on Stealth checks for you.

That creature can use a ***reaction*** to immediately move up to half its movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Infiltration
At 15th level, you have learned tricks to help you enter and move about target sites quietly. You gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on ability checks made to detect or disarm traps.
* You have advantage on saving throws against traps.
* You don't activate traps or spells that would be activated by stepping on them.

### Sudden Strike
At 18th level, you can quickly neutralize a target if you can get the drop on them. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. If the target’s remaining hp is less than twice your fighter level, you can choose to knock them out instead. If you do, you deal no damage, but the creature falls unconscious.

</div>

No matter the mission, a Guerrilla will execute it with utmost perfection. Sometimes known as commandos, these warriors are marked by their determination and adaptability. Whether harsh terrain, vicious monsters, enemy soldiers, or powerful spellcasters, nothing short of death will cause the willpower of a Guerrilla warrior to waver in the pursuit of their goals.




### Adaptable Superiority
Your training has allowed you a flexibility in technique and style not seen in other fighters. When you finish a long rest, you can choose to replace one of the maneuvers you know with another maneuver of your choice.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-juggernaut">Juggernaut</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd	| Knock 'em Down, Unburdened
| 7th	| Relentless Bulk
| 10th | Unmoving
| 15th | Reckless Charge
| 18th | Dynamic Entry

</div>

A Juggernaut is an unstoppable, overwhelming force whose advance cannot be halted nor resisted. They relentlessly charge into melee, shaking off enemy attacks before showing their martial superiority in a deadly display of force. And, as many veterans would say, few things are more fearsome than a charging juggernaut about to cleave you in two.

### Knock 'em Down
You gain proficiency with all Strength checks made to break or force your way through doors, walls, chests, locks and other objects.

When you successfully shove a Large creature or smaller after you have moved 10 ft or more in a straight line, you can choose to shove the creature up to 10 ft away in any direction you choose. If you shove a creature into a wall or other similar solid object, your momentum crushes them against it, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Strength modifier to the creature and the object.

If you shove the creature into another creature, your momentum makes them collide, dealing bludgeoning damage to both creatures equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier and knocking both creatures prone.

A creature can only be damaged by this ability once per turn. The bludgeoning damage dealt by shoving creatures increases as you gain levels in this class, increasing by 1d8 at 10th, 15th and 18th level of this class.



### Unburdened
Juggernauts are notorious for the ease they move with even while wearing cumbersome looking armor. Your speed is never reduced by wearing heavy armor, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

### Relentless Bulk
To stop your advance becomes a difficult task. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can take the Dash action as a ***bonus action***. If you take this action, opportunity attacks provoked by you are made with disadvantage until the end of your turn.

### Unmoving
You stand unwavering in the thick of danger. You can make a Constitution saving throw in place of a Dexterity saving throw.

### Reckless Charge
When using the Knock 'em Down feature, the distance you can shove a creature increases to 20 ft. Additionally, you can attempt to grapple and shove the target simultaneously with the same check, if it is Huge and smaller.

When you successfully shove away a creature that you are grappling, you can move with the creature and maintain your grapple. To maintain your grapple, you must have enough movement speed remaining for the turn to remain adjacent to the creature.

### Dynamic Entry
As an ***action***, you can gain enough momentum to smash through walls. This creates an effect similar to the *passwall* spell, but the opening you create is permanent and causes instability in the structure surrounding it.

Additionally, any creature within 15 ft of the opposite opening takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.





<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-kindler">Kindler</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Kindler Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd	| Torchbearer, Living Flame
| 7th	| Resting Bonfire
| 10th	| Inspiring Spark
| 15th	| Brilliant Flare
| 18th	| Eternal Ember

</div>

Kindlers are fighters who choose to bear a torch for others, a symbolic flame which signifies guidance, protection, and life. While to many, fire might be seen as something with no more purpose than to kill and destroy, a kindler wields its heat similarly to how another might hold a shield, though they are no stranger to using fire for offensive purposes as well.




### Torchbearer
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to wield torches as weapons. A lit torch becomes a melee weapon dealing 2d4 fire damage with the light property for you.

### Living Flame
Also, at 3rd level, you can temper your inner flame, and release it as a ***bonus action*** if you are wielding a torch. When you do so, for the next minute, whenever you hit a creature with a lit torch, you can use your ***bonus action*** to inflict one of the following conditions on the creature.

**Branding Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or be branded by you for the duration of your Living Flame. While the creature is branded, it takes 2d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Cauterizing Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be unable to regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

**Sinister Flame**. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

Effect ends early if you either choose to end it (no action required), if you let go of your torch, or if your torch is extinguished. The DC for these saving throws is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.



### Resting Bonfire
At 7th level, you can conjure up a calming fire during a long rest. At the end of a long rest, each creatures resting in proximity of it regains hit points equal to 1d4 + half of your fighter level (rounded up).

### Inspiring Spark
Beginning at 10th level, your Living Flame feature inspires confidence in your allies. While a creature is within 20 feet of you while you are using your Living Flame, it cannot be frightened.

### Brilliant Flare
Starting at 15th level, the flames that live inside of you burst out when you push yourself to your limits. When you use your Action Surge, all creatures of your choice that can see you within 20 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, or be blinded until the start of your next turn.

### Eternal Ember
By 18th level, there are no longer any limits on how often you can use your Living Flame.






<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-runeguard">Runeguard</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Runeguard Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Runecraft, Runescript
| 7th | Eyes of the Arcanist
| 10th | Sentinel’s Reckoning
| 15th | Improved Sentinel’s Reckoning
| 18th | Runic Mastery

</div>

The runeguard seeks the magical power within ancient languages, and to hasten the speed of their blade and strengthen of their armor by imbuing them with the power of these runes.




### Runecraft
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn five master runes; *Ild* (fire), *Kalt* (frost), *Ond* (spirit), *Stein* (Stone), and *Vind* (wind).

While these names are known to you as the basis for empowering your equipment, their application continues to require diligent study, constant trial, and repeated error to evoke the unique properties from each variant invocation.

#### Runic Augmentations
You learn three runic augmentations of your choice, which are detailed under “Runic Augmentations” below. Each augmentation is specific to its master rune; for instance, if you learn the Sokn augmentation of the Ild master rune, you don’t gain the ability to use the Sokn augmentation with other master runes unless you also learn that specific combination.

You learn two additional augmentations at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new augmentations, you can choose to replace one you already know with a different one.

#### Ritual Crafting
Each runic combination must be inscribed and empowered into your equipment over the course of 8 hours. Each piece of equipment must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse a part of your being into the runes, causing them to glow slightly with your own spiritual essence. The rune’s power fades if it moves more than 100 feet away from you and can’t be used by anyone other than you.



#### Augmentation Activation
During your turn, you can activate a single runic augmentation by focusing on the rune’s power. You can activate one of these augmentations on your turn using your ***bonus action*** to empower your attacks (Sokn), your ***reaction*** to entrench your defenses (Vard) or skillfully enhance another ability (Hagr) with your ***action***.

Activating a rune requires concentration, up to a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. While you concentrate on a rune, you can cast spells but you can't concentrate on a rune and a spell at the same time. You gain the ability to concentrate on two runes at once at 10th level.

Once you activate one of your runic augmentations, you must finish a short rest before you can use that augmentation again.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your runic augmentations require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Runic save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

### Runescript
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Arcana and Religion skills. Additionally, you double your proficiency bonus when making Intelligence checks that involve identifying magical writing, such as arcane sigils or divine text.

### Eyes of the Arcanist
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing the flow of magic in the immediate area, you can detect familiar patterns in the weave. The DM tells you the general location of magic writing used in rite or ritual within 60 feet, whether active or dormant, and you know the type (arcane, divine, or otherwise) of any script you sense but not its exact purpose or power.

You can use this feature a number of times a day equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Sentinel’s Reckoning
Beginning at 10th level, you can unleash the energy of your runes to devastating effect by shouting the command word Tal as an ***action*** (see “Tal” under Runic Augmentations). Choose one Tal effect from the runes you have active, and all active augmentations go dormant until you finish a short rest. You can still use other augmentations you have yet to activate.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.








### Sentinel’s Reckoning
Starting at 15th level, you can use this feature twice before a rest, but only once per turn.

### Runic Mastery
At 18th level, you can have three runes activate and you no longer need to concentrate on your runic augmentations.

## Runic Augmentations
Below are the runic augmentations for each of the five master runes. In the ancient tongues, the augmentation can be said before or after the rune.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### Sokn
    *Attack Augmentation*

    You can activate a rune with the Sokn augmentation as a ***bonus action***. A rune’s power only affects the weapon it is inscribed on.
    **Ild**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you ignite the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it takes 1d4 fire damage for each time you've burned it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such burns on itself on a success. Alternatively, the ignited creature, or a creature adjacent to it, can use an action to end the effect of all burns.

    **Kalt**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

    **Ond**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage and recover hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

    **Stein**. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a weapon attack, it must make a Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.

    **Vind**. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

- ### Vard
    *Defense Augmentation*

    You can activate a rune with the Vard augmentation as a ***reaction***. A rune’s power can only be used while wearing the armor or holding the shield it is inscribed on.
    **Ild**. When you are hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

    **Kalt**. When you are hit by a melee attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

    **Ond**. You gain a bonus to saving throws made to resist being frightened equal to your Constitution modifier.

    **Stein**. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist being moved against your will.

    **Vind**. Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage as wind whips around you.

- ### Hagr
    *Ability Augmentation*

    You can activate a rune with the Hagr augmentation as an ***action***. This rune must be inscribed on your body.
    **Ild**. You can add your Constitution modifier to your Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

    **Kalt**. You ignore difficult terrain and can walk safely across still or gently moving water.

    **Ond**. When you receive healing from any source, you also gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your proficiency bonus.

    **Stein**. You have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

    **Vind**. Your movement speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Constitution modifier (minimum 5 feet).

- ### Tal
    *Reckoning*

    Once you gain the Sentinel’s Reckoning feature at 10th level, you can activate a rune with the Tal command word as an ***action***. This rune manifests in the air around you when activated.
    **Ild**. Each adjacent creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to 2d10 × the number of runes you have active on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **Kalt**. An eruption of magical frost blasts from you in a radius equal to 10 feet × the number of runes you have active. All creatures of your choice within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for a number of rounds equal to the number of active runes. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw to break free.

    **Ond**. Life spirits swirl about you in a 5-foot-radius. All creatures of your choice within that radius regain hit points equal to 2d10 × the number of runes you have active.

    **Stein**. You release your runic power in an arc before you, creating a cone of difficult terrain as jagged earth erupts equal to 5 feet × the number of runes you have active. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d4 slashing damage.

    **Vind**. A furious cyclone whips up a strong wind around you. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed a Strength saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage, be pushed a number of feet equal to 5 × the number of runes you have active, and fall prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-sellsword">Sellsword</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Combat Pragmatics, Street Schooled
| 7th | Redirection
| 10th | Cheap Shot Artist
| 15th | Cutthroat's Withdrawal
| 18th | Steal the Kill

</div>

Some warriors fight with honor, with grace, and with virtue...and some fight for themselves. Sellswords are the embodiment of these kinds of fighters that rise from the humblest origins and earn prestige through luck, wit and strength of arms.

Whether they're a fallen knight or a lowborn cutthroat out to make a name for themselves, a Sellsword will employ whatever tactics they have to in order to claw their way to riches, fame, and victory. A sellsword seizes the advantage at the moment it presents itself, knowing that to falter or gloat before the enemy is finished is to risk death oneself.




### Combat Pragmatics
You have learnt how to employ a variety of underhanded moves to gain the upper hand in a fight. Once per turn when you hit a creature you can see within 30 feet with an attack, you can choose to either gain advantage on your next attack roll targeting that creature, or impose disadvantage on that creature's next attack roll by performing a dirty trick. This trick can represent throwing dirt in your opponent's face, striking a low blow, or delivering a deep, debilitating cut.

You can use this feature once and regain its use when you finish a short rest. Additionally you can expend a superiority to use this without spending a use.

### Street Schooled
Gain proficiency with the Sleight of Hand and Deception skills, and either the disguise kit, forgery kit, poisoner's kit, or thieves' tools.

If already proficient, you instead have advantage on all checks with that skill or tool.



### Redirection
When a creature targets you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to choose an adjacent creature no more than one size category larger than you other than the attacker to take the blow in your stead. You immediately switch places with that creature without provoking opportunity attacks, provided there is space to do so, and the attack roll targets it instead.

You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its attack roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds or fails.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

### Cheap Shot Artist
When you make a weapon attack with advantage, add 1d6 to your weapon damage.

### Cutthroat's Withdrawal
You know when things are going a little too south and how to get the hell out of dodge effectively. While you are below half of your maximum hit points, your movement does not incur opportunity attacks.

### Steal the Kill
When a creature you can see takes a critical hit, you can use your ***reaction*** to move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks and make one attack against that creature.

If this attack reduces the creature to 0 hit points, you can gloat about it as part of this reaction and gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-Skirmisher">Skirmisher / Mariner</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Skirmisher Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | No Escape
| 7th | Leaping Attack
| 10th | Evasion
| 15th | Flow like Water
| 18th | Whirlwind attack

</div>

The skirmisher is a warrior trained for speed. They use their superior mobility to take the fight to their opponents and keep them off balance. A fighter built for maneuverability from an aquatic setting is called a mariner and follows the same rules (but choosing the swimming option for No Escape at 3rd level).





### No Escape
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you may use your ***reaction*** to move up to half your speed when a creature you can see that is hostile to you moves. In addition, you suffer no penalty to movement while either swimming or climbing (chosen when this archetype is taken).



### Leaping Attack
At 7th level, after moving at least 10 feet prior to attacking, you have advantage on your first attack.

### Evasion
At 10th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Flow like Water
At 18th level, your base speed increases by 5 feet and you become proficient in Dexterity saving throws.

### Whirlwind attack
Starting at 18th level, as an **action**, you may make an attack against every enemy within your reach. Each enemy can only be attacked once.

Throughout history, myth, and fiction, warriors have often had a religious focus. The cult of Ares, the Norse úlfheðnar, the cult of Mithras and of course the Templars are all examples of this. The Templar is a fighter archetype that parallels the Eldritch Knight - using magic similar to clerics rather than wizards. Their focus remains firmly martial - their magical powers are much more limited than clerics, or even paladins. This version of the religious warrior is one of a cult member initiated into secrets. The Templars gain their powers as much from the study of ritual and cult secrets as from a divine power.




### Learned
Though the study of cult lore, you become proficient with a single intelligence-based skill other than investigation at 3rd level. While religion is the most common topic a Templar might gain, each cult and each member focus on different lore.

### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain divinely inspired magical ability. Your spells come from the cleric list.

#### Cantrips
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots
The Templar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known
You know one 1st-level cleric spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Templar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

In addition, pick a cleric domain. You know all domain specific 1st level spells of that domain. At level 7 you learn all domain specific 2nd level spells, at 13th level the 3rd level spells and at 19th level the 4th level spells.




#### Templar Spellcasting Table
| Level | Cantrips | Spells Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | 2 | 1 | 2 | - | - | - |

| 20th | 3 | 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |


Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. However, you may not swap out a domain spell. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

  **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Domain lore
At 7th level, you gain the domain abilities of a 1st level cleric of the domain you selected at 3rd level. If heavy armor or martial weapons are part of what would be gained, you instead gain proficiency in another intelligence-based skill other than investigation. If the ability mentions "cleric level", use your fighter level divided by 3.

### Ritual magic
At 10th level you may learn 2 cleric rituals of level 2 or lower. Unless those are spells you otherwise know, you may not cast them as anything other than rituals. At 15th level you gain an additional cleric ritual which must be of 3rd level or lower. At 20th level you learn a final ritual and it may be up to a level 4 cleric spell.








### Additional domain lore
At 15th level you gain the 2nd level domain ability of your domain. If the ability mentions "cleric level", use your fighter level divided by 3 instead. If that ability involves channel divinity, you have one use of channel divinity which is regained after a long rest.

### Ritual master
At level 18 you gain the ability to cast any ritual you learned though this archetype as an ***action*** (rather than the 10 minutes typically used).

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-thingSlinger">Thing Slinger</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Prerequisite
- Strength score of 16 or higher

#### Archetype Features
| Fighter Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 3rd | Built Different, Who Needs Swords?
| 7th | Who Needs Crossbows?
| 10th | Y.E.E.T - Your Existence Ends Today
| 15th | I’ll Beat a Rapscallion…
| 18th | …with ANOTHER Rapscallion!

</div>

They say that when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Sometimes, when all you have is a group of enemies, not just everything, but everybody, begins to look like both a hammer and a nail.

To the hard-pressed combatant, the broken leg of a table might serve their purpose just as well as a club. To the archetypical Thing Slinger, just about any piece of solid mass they can find will be used to full advantage better than even the most extravagant sword.

A table? Just throw it. A cannon? Throw it. The enemy’s whole carriage? Yup, throw it. The huge owlbear currently blocking your path? Why, throw it as well!

With no regards to practicality or physics, these unrelenting brutes bulldoze through the battlefield by transforming their surroundings into their own personal arsenal.


### Built Different
Gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. If you are already proficient in this skill, you gain advantage on any ability checks you make with it instead.

### Who Needs Swords?
Certainly not you. No, you prefer to save your time and coins. They all break in the end anyway, so might as well use what’s around you, right?

You can treat any object as an martial improvised weapon, as long as it has a size of Large or smaller.

Small objects count as Light weapons (*1d6 damage*), Medium objects as Veratile weapons (*1d8/1d10*) and Large objects as Heavy Two-handed weapons (*2d6*).

### Who Needs Crossbows?
Having to put things inside of other things, just so you can then launch them at your enemies? Pfff, couldn’t be you.



You can treat any Large or smaller object as a thrown weapon. Small objects have a range of 20/60; Medium objects have 15/40; and Large objects have 10/30, but deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier to all creatures adjacent to the target (even on a miss).

### Y.E.E.T - Your Existence Ends Today
You’ve mastered the art of throwing objects at your enemies. But why stop at that, when you could be throwing your enemies themselves?

You can use grappled creatures of your size or smaller as thrown weapons. You must succeed on a Strength check (DC 8 + the target’s Strength modifier + their Dexterity modifier) before being able to launch them as one of your attacks. On a failed check, the grappled creature is not thrown and gains advantage on ability checks made to escape during its next turn.

If the targeted creature is prone, you can grapple them without the need of a grapple check, and have advantage on ability checks made to hurl them.

Thrown creatures deal damage as an object, but also receive the damage themselves.

### I’ll Beat a Rapscallion…
Your ability to sling things reaches a new height:

Attacking while a hostile creature is adjacent doesn’t impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls you make with thrown weapons.

Attacks you make with improvised weapons now deal an additional 1d4 damage on a hit per size of the object or creature being used (Small = 1d4, Medium = 2d4, etc).

Large thrown weapons now deal damage equal to double your Strength modifier to adjacent creatures.

### …with ANOTHER Rapscallion!
You are no longer content with just throwing your enemies. It’s time to go bigger: they shall now become your sword! Literally!

You can creatures one step larger than you as part of the Your Existence Ends Today feature.

Additionally, you can now use grappled creatures of yor size or smaller as improvised melee weapons, but you must succeed on a Strength check (DC 10 + the target’s Strength modifier + their Dexterity modifier) before being able to swing them. On a failed check, the grappled creature is not swung and can immediately make an ability check to escape.

You must repeat this check whenever you attempt to use a creature in this way for the first time on your turn.

This deals type deal an additional 2d4 damage on a hit per size tier of the creature being used (Small = 2d4, Medium = 4d4), and the total amount of damage dealt is also dealt to them. The additional damage is not applied if the creature is dead.

| 3rd | Hackles Up, Scrappy
| 7th | Frantic Instinct
| 10th | Adrenaline Rush
| 15th | Still Standing
| 18th | Tooth and Nail

</div>

In a world of undead hordes and magical demigods, a mere mortal with just their wit and weaponry might feel a little outclassed. Nonetheless, there are plenty of seemingly mundane individuals who succeed time and time again in overcoming the odds through a combination of skill, luck, and sheer grit. A fighter who embodies this archetype might be anything from a plate-wearing knight who faces down dragons, to an urchin alley brawler run afoul of the local gangs.

Through trial, error, loss and hardship, you have honed your ability to take on entire mobs, or towering monsters. You know how to take a hit, how to survive, and how to pick yourself back up off the ground.




### Hackles Up
You fight with extra grit against difficult odds, whether you are outnumbered or out of your weight class. For each adjacent hostile creature, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC and attack and damage rolls. If one or more adjacent enemies is Large or larger, you also gain a +1 bonus.

The maximum bonus you can achieve in this way is +3.

At 7th level, and again at 15th level, the maximum bonus you can achieve in this way increases by 1.



### Scrappy
You gain proficiency with improvised weapons and the Survival skill. If you are already proficient with the Survival skill, you instead advantage on all Survival checks.

### Frantic Instinct
When you are blinded, deafened, frightened, grappled, restrained, or knocked prone, you can use your ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack against the source of the condition if it is within range.

Once per turn, when you have at least a +2 bonus through your Hackles Up feature, you can make an attack with advantage.

### Adrenaline Rush
Your will to survive can lend you desperate power when backed into a corner. When you recover hit points using your Second Wind feature, you can also regain one Superiority.

### Still Standing
Though you might sway and stumble, you won't drop your guard until you drop entirely. If you are below half of your maximum hit points, you gain a +1 bonus through your Hackles Up feature.

In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level whenever you succeed on a new saving throw made using your Indomitable feature.

### Tooth and Nail
Your ferocity in a tight spot is truly terrifying. You can use your Action Surge up to twice in one turn when you have at least a +2 bonus through your Hackles Up feature.

At the end of your turn after using this feature, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion.





<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-FightingStyles">Fighting Styles</a></h2>

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

    If you have the Brawler feat, you also gain the following option:

    **Counterpunch**.

You must not be wielding any other weapons, and not be wearing a shield to perform a counterpunch.

- #### Cavalry
    Whenever you are mounted, you may add your proficiency bonus to the saving throws and AC of your steed. In addition you have advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

</div>




<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-combatManeuvers">Maneuvers</a></h2>

If a maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the maneuver at the same time you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your class level.

Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

### Basic maneuvers
The following maneuvers cost 1 superiority to use.

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Ambush
    When you make an initiative roll, or any type of stealth check, you can add a superiority die to the roll.  You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result.

- #### Athletic Prowess
    When you move, you can roll a superiority die, adding it to any Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity ability checks you make until you stop moving.

- #### Bait and Switch
    If adjacent to an ally, you can switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll a superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

- #### Commander's Strike
    When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a ***bonus action*** to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see and hear you. That creature can immediately use its ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack, adding your superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

- #### Commanding Presence
    When you make a Charisma check to influence other creatures that you share a language with, add your superiority die to the ability check. You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result.

- #### Combat Focus
    As a ***reaction***, you can roll a Superiority Die and add that number to a save. You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result.

- #### Defensive Shove
    As a ***bonus action***, you can shove an adjacent friendly creature out of harm's way. It moves 10 feet in the direction of your choice, and until the start of your next turn, it can add your superiority die to either its AC or a save the next time it is targeted by an attack or spell.

- #### Expert Deflection
    *Prerequisite: 10th level*

    As a ***reaction*** reduce the damage from an attack that hits you or an adjacent ally by two superiority dice worth.

- #### Feinting Attack
    You can use a ***bonus action*** to feint, choosing one adjacent creature as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

- #### Goading Attack
    When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

- #### Heroic Might
    You can expend a superiority die to perform a momentary feat of strength beyond that of ordinary men. Add your superiority die to your Strength for the purposes of determining how far or high you can jump, or how much weight you can lift, carry, push, or throw.

    This temporary Strength lasts until you finish the feat (such as leaping a crevasse), or one minute, whichever is shorter.

- #### Living Shield
    When an adjacent friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can roll your superiority die as a ***reaction***. The damage the friendly creature takes is reduced by twice the die result, and you take half that damage.

- #### Lunging Attack
    When you take the Attack action, you can increase your reach with melee weapon attacks by 5 ft until the end of your turn.

    Once during your turn, if you hit a creature with a lunging attack, you may add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

- #### Maneuvering Attack
    When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. Add your superiority die to the damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its ***reaction*** to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

- #### Menacing Attack
    When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can attempt to frighten the target. Add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

- #### Parry
    When you are damaged by a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** and reduce the damage by your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

- #### Precision Attack
    When you make an attack roll against a creature, you can add your one superiority die to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

- #### Pushing Attack
    When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can attempt to drive the target back. Add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

- #### Rally
    You can use a ***bonus action*** to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see and hear you to gain temporary hit points.

    You grant more temporary hit points as you gain fighter class levels and become a more inspiring battle master.

    | 12th | 3d10 + fighter level
    | 17th | 4d12 + fighter level

- #### Riposte
    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, add your superiority die to the damage roll.

- #### Shrug It Off
    At the start of your turn, if affected by any effect that places one of these conditions on you: blinded, deafened, frightened, charmed, paralyzed, petrified, stunned or unconscious, you can make an additional saving throw against it with advantage.

- #### Studious Eye
    When making an insight or investigation check while observing something, add your superiority die to the ability check. You can do this after the roll, but before you know the result.

- #### Sweeping Attack
    When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature adjacent to the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

- #### Wolf Pack Tactics
    *Prerequisite: 10th level*

    When an ally that you can see hits with a weapon attack on their turn, you can use your ***reaction*** to move up to half your speed and make a weapon attack against the same target. Add your superiority die to the damage roll.

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Disarming Attack
    When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. Add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet. If you are adjacent to the target and have a free hand, you may catch the disarmed item.

- #### Distracting Strike
    When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. Add your superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

- #### Evasive Footwork
    When you move, you can roll your superiority die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

    This maneuver also allows you to dodge an attack with some evasive, reactive footwork. When another creature attacks you with a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to roll your one superiority die and add the number to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

- #### Immortal Fortitude
    If you would be reduced to 0 or less Hit Points after receiving damage, you can, as a ***reaction***, make a Constitution Save against a DC of half the damage dealt against you or DC 15, whichever is higher, to survive the attack and remain at 1 Hit Point.

- #### Juggernaut Charge
    When you take the Dash action, you can expend a superiority die and charge in a straight line through any number of creatures your size or smaller. Each time you do so, the creature can choose to either take your superiority die plus your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage or move 5 feet into an empty space as a reaction. If you would end your turn in another creature's space, you are instead shunted to the nearest empty space, provoking opportunity attacks from any hostile creature that can reach you.

- #### Overwhelming Mountain Strikes
    When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can add your superiority die to the damage roll. In addition, the creature struck must make a Strength save or halve their movement until the end of their next turn. If a second strike is made on the same target during the same turn by you after failing the Strength Save, the creature also loses their bonus action, and if a third strike is successful, they lose their reaction as well.

- #### Snipe
    As a ***bonus action***, you can make a ranged weapon attack. If you hit, add your superiority die to the damage roll. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of making this attack.

- #### Spinning Swing
    *Prerequisite: 10th level*

    Instead of a single attack, all creatures in your reach must make a Dexterity save or take two superiority dice worth of damage of the same type as a weapon you are holding.

- #### Trip Attack
    When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, as a ***bonus action*** you can attempt to knock the target down. Add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.
