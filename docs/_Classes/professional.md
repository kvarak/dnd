# Professional
Every professional is defined by a specific mundane field, such as a craft, a profession or an art form. From years of study and practice, they master the basic methods of their field. But that is just the first step to true progress, the development of new methods and approaches. A true professional is never satisfied. They are always seeking out new ways to improve their knowledge.

The life of a professional often times begins in the mundane, as a simple craftsman or a sage. For some, the mundane life is too slow, and when their skills becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. For the truly curious, the adventuring life is the only way to expand one's horizons of knowledge and build one's skill. Whether they're seeking some lost knowledge, want to test a new theory, or hoping to find new questions to ask, professionals often find themselves in ancient, lost, and often dangerous, places to find them.

Typically, a professional will make his or her biggest contributions to an adventuring party outside of combat. Their knowledge and expertise make them valuable in many situations that adventurers find themselves in. However, as they continue adventuring, their dedication and will to learn allows them to pick up many of the skills needed for this dangerous life. In some ways it could be said that in addition to being masters in their chosen field, they become adventuring professional.

</div>

As a professional, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8

#### Saving Throws
You are proficient with ***Wisdom*** saving throws.

#### Skills
**Class Skills:** All Craft, all Knowledge and Profession

**Skill Points:** You gain 4 skill points at 1st level.

**Additional Skills:** You gain 3 additional skill points to spend on on single Craft. *Note that **Journeyman crafter** and **Master crafter** are much more difficult to gain during play.*

#### Skills - Combat
**Weapon Groups:** You have rank 1 with Club, Knife, Spear, Staff, Crossbow and Sling.

**Combat Skill Points:** You gain 1 skill point to spend on combat skills at 1st level.

**Recommended:** *Light armor*

**After 1st level:** You gain 1 skill point to spend on combat skills every 3rd level, at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- Any two tools or tool kits

### Adaption
By necessity you have a nimble mind and take to anything new quickly. If you have seen a creature make any type of ability check, attack roll or Dexterity saving throw within the last 10 minutes, you can spend a Talent die, a d6, and add the number rolled to your own roll of the same type.

You may instead spread your knowledge and experience to those around you, guiding them towards success. You can spend 1 minute advising your companions in a skill you are proficient with. A number of friendly creatures up to your Wisdom modifier may add your Talent die to a check with the chosen skill made within the next hour.

In both cases the decision to use the Talent die can wait until after you the d20 is rolled, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

Your Talent die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and may regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.

In addition, select one of the following:

***Theoretical field***: You learn three cantrips of your choice from your spell list.

#### Spell slots
The Professional table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice. Unless otherwise noted in your field of expertise, those cantrips are from the professional spell list.

The Spells Known column of the professional table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from your spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast any spell from your spell list you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a set of appropriate tools as a spellcasting focus for your professional spells.

### Quick Study
You can prepare yourself to take on any challenge by analyzing and training. From 2nd level, you can spend 1 hour in preparation to gain to gain 1 temporary skill point to spend on a skill for which you have the prerequisites. This benefit lasts until you use this ability to gain another proficiency this way.

### Tool Belt
While other adventurers may rely on spells, or luck, or brute strength to solve a problem, you believe in always having the right tool on hand. From 2nd level, following a long rest, you can use your ***action*** to retrieve a piece of non-magical gear from your belt, apron, pack, cart, or wherever you keep your tools, even if you did not have it in your inventory before. This item cannot have a gp cost higher than 5 times your class level.

Items retrieved this way remain in your inventory until you take a long rest. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and may regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.

### Trial and Error
Starting at 5th level, you can adapt your tactics, try to predict your foes patterns and get the upper hand. Once during your turn, when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as a ***bonus action***. On that attack you can choose to have advantage, or deal an additional 1d8 damage.

At 11th level, the additional damage increases to 2d8.

### Keen Mind
From 7th level, if you fail a saving throw that you are proficient with, you may reroll it. If you do so, you must use the new roll and can’t use this feature again until you finish a short rest.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. When you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you may reroll it. If you do so, you must use the new roll.

### Expanded knowledge
You gain 2 additional skill points.

### Superior Adaption
At 18th level, when you roll initiative and have no Talent dice left, you regain one.

### Pinnacle of Achievement
At 20th level, your Wisdom increases by 2 and your maximum becomes 22.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-arcanist">Arcanist</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Arcanist Features
| Professional Level | Feature |
| :----------------: | :------ |
| 1st | Arcane Spellcasting,<br/>Bonus Skills,<br/>Magic Item Analysis |
| 3rd | Savvy Arcanist |
| 6th | Superior Attunement |
| 9th | Master of Arcane Theory |
| 13th | Use Magic Device |
| 17th | Superior Attunement |

</div>

You have spent your life studying and understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse an arcanist from his  academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.

Arcanist are usually a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The result of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates the effect.

### Arcane Spellcasting
Select an arcane tradition from the Wizard class. When selecting cantrips and other spells, use the spell list of that tradition.

### Bonus Skills
You gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws and 1 additional skill point to spend on the *Arcana* skill.

### Magic Item Analysis
Your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the spells *detect magic* and *identify*, and you can cast them as rituals. You don’t need to provide a material component when casting *identify* with this class feature.

### Savvy Arcanist
You have studied it in theory and your understanding of the processes that go into magic is of a level even some wizards will never obtain. You understand precisely the amount of effort and concentration that goes into casting or maintaining spells. Whenever you cause a target to make a concentration check, it has disadvantage on that check.

Additionally, you can cast spells from scrolls even if you do not have them on a known spell list. To cast the spell, you must succeed at an Arcana check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

### Superior Attunement
Your superior understanding of magic items allows you to master their use. The *Arcana - Artifice - Master attuner* costs 0 for you. If you have that skill already, you may spend a skill point on any other class skill.

### Master of Arcane Theory
You have studied enough magic to understand the limitations and flaws of most spells. As a ***reaction***, when you see a spell being cast, you can gain advantage on any saves against that spell.

### Use Magic Device
You have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

### Superior Attunement
If you have the *Master attuner* skill, you can instead attune to five magic items.






<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-archaeologist">Archaeologist</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archaeologist Features
| Professional Level | Feature |
| :----------------: | :------ |
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies,<br/>Whip Master |
| 3rd | Explorer’s Tricks |
| 6th | Extra Attack |
| 9th | Ruin Researcher |
| 13th | Fortune’s Favor |
| 17th | Paragon of Adventure |

</div>

Archaeologists explore the isolated reaches of the world lost to history and time. Such places are almost always dangerous, however, and many secrets held within these hidden locations are guarded by beings who would fight and die to keep them.

An archaeologist must be prepared for traps, danger, and deadly combat when delving into the world's most perilous places, but this risk is often much of what makes their discoveries worthwhile. An eccentric lot, archaeologists often believe heavily in luck, intelligence, and skill, trusting to their tools as easily as trusting a roll of the dice.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws and 1 additional skill point to spend on the *History* skill.

### Whip Master
You have mastered the use of whips as both a weapon and a tool. Gain 3 skill points to spend on the *Whip* weapon group. In addition you gain the following benefits while wielding a whip.

- When using a whip, its damage die changes from a d4 to a d6 and it counts as a light weapon.

- Select a fighting style from the fighter class list. While wielding a whip, you have access to the benefits of that fighting style.

- Once per turn, if you hit a creature with a whip, you can force it to make a Strength save (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If it fails, you can knock it prone, grapple it, pull it 5 feet towards you or force it to drop an item it is holding. *(i.e. this means you can do it once during your turn and once if you attack as a reaction)*

- You can use your whip as a short grappling hook to grasp onto an object within its reach in order to hold yourself to it, climb toward it, or pull it toward you.

- When you jump, you can use a ***bonus action*** at any point in your jump's trajectory to lash out and swing from an anchoring point within reach of your whip. This extends your jump by the reach of your whip, or twice that distance on a long jump. This extra distance does not consume movement.

### Explorer’s Tricks
You have learned a handful of techniques that help you comprehend the secrets found in the ancient places of the world. You gain a number of Explorer's points equal to your Wisdom modifier + 1, each of which may be expended to use one of the abilities listed here. You regain all expended explorer's points with a long rest.

 **Ancient Dangers**. When you are within a ruin, dungeon, cave, or other work of architecture, you may spend one minute studying either an artistic or written depiction you can see of a specific type of creature, or an artifact left by that type of creature. Depictions may potentially be found on the walls of the structure, or on art, weapons, or objects within the structure. If this creature has a subtype (for example: devil, shapechanger, or Orc), use any applicable subtypes it has instead of its creature type. For the next 24 hours, any time you roll initiative within this area and can see a creature of this type or subtype, you have advantage on your initiative roll.

 **Eye for Treasure**. You cast either *identify* or *locate object* as a 10 minute ritual without expending a spell slot or any materials cost.

 **Polyglot**. Choose a language. For the next 10 minutes, you can understand the general meaning of written words in that language, though specifics, idioms, and metaphors may still elude you.

### Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Ruin Researcher
You have an instinctive sense for the architecture, history, and inhabitants of the forgotten places of the World. If you are in a ruin, dungeon, cave, or other work of architecture, you may make an Wisdom (*History*) check over the course of an hour. In addition to the knowledge about the area's history and culture that would usually be conferred by such a check, you gather extra information based on the result of the roll.

If this check has a result of 10 or greater, you learn what sorts of traps and secret doors may be in the area (out to a radius of 1,000 feet), what their triggers could be, but not their locations.

If this check has a result of 15 or greater, you learn what creature types are in the area, and their approximate quantities (for example: “many aberrations, some undead, few beasts").

If this check has a result of 20 or greater, you learn the identity of whichever treasure has the greatest monetary worth in the area. This treasure must be non-magical and, though you do not automatically know where it is, it becomes a valid target for a *locate object* spell cast by you.

### Fortune’s Favor
You have learned to rely on your luck and can take risks that others would consider foolish. When you make any attack, check or saving throw and dislike the result, you may expend an explorer's point to substitute 10 for the result of the roll.

### Paragon of Adventure
Your reputation and glory as an explorer are unrivaled. You regain all expended explorer's points after a short rest.







<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-astronomer">Astronomer</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Astronomer Features
| Professional Level | Feature |
| :----------------: | :------ |
| 1st | Arcane Spellcasting,<br/>Bonus Skills,<br/>Foretold Foe |
| 3rd | Read the Sky |
| 6th | Heaven's Will |
| 9th | Divine Insight |
| 13th | Signs and Portents |
| 17th | Portentous Omen |

</div>

You spent a significant portion of your life studying the stars, planets, and other wonders of the universe. You can use the clues observed in the sky to help you discern realities about the world around you. You are interested in mysteries of the universe and the forces that rule it.

### Arcane Spellcasting
When selecting cantrips and other spells, use the same spell list as a wizard from the school of Divination.

### Bonus Skills
You gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws and 1 additional skill point to spend on the *Astronomy* skill.

### Foretold Foe
As a ***bonus action*** on the first round of combat, you can designate a creature that you can see as your foretold foe, who you have learned of and prepared for through your divinations. When you see your foretold foe make an attack roll or saving throw, you can choose to force them to roll again. You can use this ability after the result is known, but before the DM determines if it succeeds. They must keep the second result.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Read the Sky
You gain the ability to cast the *augury* spell as a ritual by consulting skycharts and your recent astronomical observations. If you can see the night sky as you cast the spell, you can receive an omen about any course of action you take in the next 24 hours, rather than 30 minutes.

### Heaven's Will
When you cast the *augury* spell, you learn the name of the creature most likely to cause the result. For example, if you asked for an omen about a journey through the woods and received a result of woe, you might learn the name of the bandit king operating in the area. You can designate this creature as an additional foretold foe, allowing you one more use of the Foretold foe feature.

### Divine Insight
You are always aware of your foretold foe's presence and location if they are within 60 ft of you. Additionally, you have resistance to damage dealt by your foretold foe.

### Signs and Portents
An astronomer develops a deeper understanding of the messages in the night sky. When you prepare spells after a long rest, you may leave a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier unchosen. You are considered to have chosen them based on signs from the night sky, and can decide upon casting which spell you actually prepared.

### Portentous Omen
You receive three omens which recharge when you finish a long rest. On your turn, you can expend an omen to receive a premonition of the near future.

Play out your turn as normal. When your premonition ends, you return to your initial position with all expended resources, and can choose to either follow the exact actions you did in the premonition, or do something different. If you choose to imitate the premonition, use the same dice results that you used in the premonition.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again in the same turn.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-candlemaker">Candlemaker</a></h1>

#### Candlemaker Features
| Professional Level | Feature |

| 3rd | Everburning Candles |
| 6th | Torchling |
| 9th | Unfettered Candle |
| 13th | Invocation |
| 17th | Pure Beacon |

</div>

Candlemaking is a simple craft, but also an old and oft forgotten discipline of magic, whose practice is among the most mysterious in all spellcasting. It is based in wax, which is both the base and fuel for flame; a moldable thing, melted and poured in layers to be fed to the fire. Secrets can be held within wax -- secrets, or spells.

Candle casters, as arcane masters of this craft are often known, fashion candles with stores of arcane energy in the wax, and a single spell hidden in the wick, which are revealed as the flame ignites. They are apt to carry many candles with many types of magic, for whatever need might arise, and even a few mundane ones, for when it is merely dark.

### Bonus Skills
You gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws and 1 additional skill point to spend on *Crafting*.

### Features
***Death Burst***. When the torchling dies, it explodes in a burst of fire and wax. Creatures within 10 ft must make a DC 11 Dex saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects not worn or carried in that area are ignited.

***Fire Form***. The torchling can move through a space as narrow as 1-inch wide. In addition, it can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 2d6 fire damage.

***Illumination***. The torchling sheds bright light in a 15 ft radius and dim light in an additional 15 ft.

***Water Susceptibility***. For every 5 ft. the torchling moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

### Candle Casting
When you select this Field of expertise, you can cast your spells through the lighting of an arcane candle. You can convert any number of nonmagical candles into arcane candles for no cost over a long rest by providing a mix of material components from a material component pouch when you create them.

Whenever you cast a spell that has a somatic and/or a material component without a gp cost, you can replace those components by lighting a candle instead. Doing so ties the spell's power to the candle. If the spell has a duration of instantaneous, it burns the candle to its base in a matter of seconds, as the spell's power is released. If the spell requires your concentration, you automatically succeed ability checks you make to maintain the concentration, but the spell ends if the candle's flame is extinguished (such is by high winds or a splash of water), as if you lost concentration on the spell.

### Everburning Candles
When you light a nonmagical candle, it burns twice as brightly, casting bright light in a 10 ft radius and dim light for an additional 10 ft. Additionally, the candle does not produce heat, consume oxygen, or burn down. You can magically quench or smother the candle's flame as an ***action***.

Starting at 6th level, when you light an everburning candle, you can choose for the light to only be visible only to yourself and creatures you choose.

### Torchling
Whenever you cast a spell which deals fire damage or radiant damage, or creates light in an area, you can use your ***bonus action*** to conjure a torchling to your side. The torchling is friendly to you and your companions, and acts on your turn. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue (no action required).

The torchling lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until the spell ends or after a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell cast, whichever is longer. At the end of this duration, the torchling explodes, as per its Death Burst trait. You can only have one torchling at a time.

### Unfettered Candle
You can create arcane candles containing a portion of your own magic. When you prepare spells following a long rest, you can create arcane candles of any spell of 5th level or lower you have prepared, expending spell slots and spell components as if you cast the spell normally.

Any creature with an Intelligence of 10 or higher that lights this candle can cast the spell contained within it, using your spell attack roll and saving throw DC, as appropriate. Casting the spell by lighting the candle requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the candle burns to its base and can no longer be lit. If the casting is interrupted, the candle is lost.

You can create a number of candles equal to your Wisdom modifier, and all unused candles become mundane candles when you finish a long rest.

### Invocation
During a long rest you can create a lesser candle of invocation. You choose the candle's alignment when you create it. The candle's magic is activated when you light the candle, which requires an action. The candle is destroyed when it is snuffed, or after it burns for 1 minute.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30 ft radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with disadvantage.

The candle becomes a nonmagical candle after 24 hours.

### Pure Beacon
The light of your candles reveals even treacherous magic for what it really is. While holding a candle the light from that source reveals things as follows:
- Magical darkness is illuminated as though it were normal darkness.
- Invisible creatures or objects are revealed with a warm, glowing outline.
- Visual illusions within the light are immediately seen as such. If the illusion involves a saving throw, all creatures that can see it while it is in the light automatically succeed.
- Shapechangers and creatures whose form has been magically altered are perceived as their original form.

A true chef does her duty regardless of where she is: to feed the hungry, and to do it with panache. A chef can create works of art through her fine courses, or whip up delicious stews out of scraps from the wilds. While many chefs prefer to their culinary arts from the comforts of the kitchen, some chefs fear not the unknown and instead see it as a source of exotic and exciting ingredients. Chefs are masters of improvisation and take care of their kin with the most wonderful of dishes.

</div>


### Chef Fighting Style
Choose one of the following fighting styles.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Skewer.** You master the spear, gaining 1 skill point to spend on the *Spear* weapon group. While wielding a spear, if you move at least 15 ft in a straight line towards a creature and successfully hit it, that target must succeed at a Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be pushed back up to 10 feet. If the target is pushed into or adjacent to another creature, you may deal the same amount of damage to that creature equal to the damage dealt to the initial target.

A Bleeding target takes damage equal to your Wisdom modifier at the start of their next turn.

If an enemy successfully hits you while you are holding a shield, you may use your ***reaction*** to slam that enemy with the shield, dealing damage equal to your Strength modifier.

</div>

In addition you are able to use your chef's utensils as an arsenal of weaponry, as shown in the Culinary Weaponry table. If a culinary weapon is lost or destroyed, you can replace them after by shopping in an urban area. Your culinary weapons can be enchanted like regular weapons and you have proficiency with them.


#### Culinary Weapons

### Snacks
You have experiences many different cuisines and ingredients on your travels, and learn how to make some fantastical snacks. You may select one type of snack from the Snacks table.

Using your cook's utensils, you can spend a long rest to create convenient Snacks for consumption. You can carry a number of Snacks equal to your Wisdom modifier, and Snacks that are not consumed after a long rest will expire. Actually only the magical effect will expire, as they are probably just as tasty for a couple of days after making.

Consuming a Snack is an ***item action*** and after 1 minute the imbued magical effect is applied to the creature consuming the Snack. A creature can only be under the effect of one Snack at any time, and the effects fade after 1 hour unless otherwise noted.

You can carry 1 additional daily Snacks, and add one additional Snack effect at 3rd, 6th, 9th level, 13th level, and again at 17th level.

#### Types of Snacks
Whenever a saving throw is required, the DC is 8 + the user's Constitution modifier + the user's proficiency bonus, with the user being the creature that consumed the Snack.

When the Snack die is mentioned, it is equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. This increases to 2d6 at 6th level and increases again to 3d6 at 13th level.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Arcane Delights**. You can fold a spell into any form of baked goods, from pies, to cakes, to biscuits. When creating this sweet snack, you can expend a spell slot to fold a spell into one item of pastry. When the pastry is consumed, the spell is released, targeting the creature that activated it. If the spell requires concentration, the target can maintain concentration. If it doesn't, the spell ends at the start of the creature's next turn.

- **Draconic Spice**. Once while under the effects of this snack, the target may use an ***action*** to spit a 15 ft cone of fire. Each creature caught inside the cone of fire must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to the Snack die.

- **Magic Morsel**. Target recovers hit points equal to your Snack die.

- **Raucous Belch**. The creature gains the ability to release a loud and odorous burp. Once while under the effects of this snack, as an ***action*** it may have each creature in a 10 foot cone originating from it make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, targets are poisoned until the start of burpers next turn.

-  **Spicy, roasted pepper**. When ingested this snack reacts with the stomach’s juices to create a fiery sensation that warms the body and manifests a fever. The target gains resistance to cold.

- **Hot Wings**. When ingested it causes intense sweating that greases the body. The target gains fire resistance.

- **Deep Fried Candybar**. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and its carrying capacity doubles.

 **Flour Smokescreen.** As an ***action***, you can create a 20 ft radius flour smokescreen centered on a point within 20 ft. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.

 **Grease Slick.** As an ***action***, you can toss a grease slick onto the ground in a 10 ft radius centered on a point within 20 ft and turn it into difficult terrain for one minute. When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

 **Smelling Salts.** You discover the perfect mix of spices to create such a visceral and powerful assault on the nose as to break a creature from its stupor. As a ***bonus action*** you may wave these spices under the nose of a stunned or frightened creature. The creature makes a saving throw against the condition on your turn. At 13th level, these spices have effect on the paralyzed condition as well.

 **Spice of Life.** You keep ready a sachet of spices up your sleeves to throw when times get desperate. When a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can give them disadvantage as a ***reaction***. Once you use this, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Extra Attack

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

At 17th level, your Magnificent meal requires only 100 gp worth of ingredients instead of the usual material component.

### Master Chef
You have reached the pinnacle of culinary expertise. You can serve full course meals in the blink of an eye and the dishes you prepare are so delicious that people who eat them will enter a state of blissful ecstasy. Once per long rest, you can enter a state of culinary fury to serve dishes at a blinding, super-humanly fast speed. For 1 minute, you can feed all friendly creatures within 15 ft a bite of freshly served deliciousness. You grant them the benefits of any Snack you know, without spending any Snack from the ones prepared daily.

Also, if you cook a meal during a long rest, you and anyone who eats your food can gain 3d10 temporary hp that last up to 1 full day.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-forester">Forester</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Forester Features
| Professional Level | Feature |
| :----------------: | :------ |
| 1st | Bonus Skills, Master Axeman |
| 3rd | Expert Traveller, Naturalist |
| 6th | Expedition Mastery, Extra Attack |
| 9th | Solid Like An Oak |
| 13th | Natural Cartography |
| 17th | Unstoppable |

</div>

The forester is a wilderness expert, her abilities derived from long and intimate relationship with the outdoors. For some, this acquaintanceship comes as the natural consequence of a frontier or tribal upbringing. Others acquire their skills while pursuing their livelihood; these include but are certainly not limited to hunters, trappers, herders, woodcutters, herbalists, prospectors, and game wardens. Among humans, few foresters receive formal training. The exceptions are those trained to serve as elite military scouts or border wardens.

Foresters are hardened by wilderness life far from the comforts of civilization. They are toughened by the challenges posed by a sometimes-dangerous natural world, and while they lack formal combat training, they are no strangers to weapons.

While the archetypical outdoorsman who lends the class her name is a woodsman, the abilities of the class are adaptable to all terrain types and climates. The class can equally represent a character at home in the mountains, plains, jungle, swamp, or desert, in equatorial heat or frigid arctic climes.

Cutting down trees may just be the most dangerous job you can get. Away from civilization, surrounded by hundreds of powerful, murderous things, and doing the exact thing that they hate. Being a lumberjack means you had to fight for your life countless times, from raging beasts to poisonous arrows, curses, treants, you name it.

<div class="infoarea">

#### Lumberjack
***Real-life lumberjack**: Boy howdy I hope that tree don't fall on me.*

***Fantasy lumberjack**: Boy howdy I hope that tree don't rip my limbs apart. And I don't accidentally anger the elves, or the dryads, or the druids, and the forest gods, and the…*

</div>

The seasoned lumberjack is, by necessity, a seasoned fighter that has fought many enemies, but unlike other jobs, they weren't just monsters, they were intelligent creatures. Many woodcutters try to make deals with the forest creatures to avoid fights, cut and hunt only in some areas, respect quotas. As a result, this fighter is also a diplomat and knows the importance of a solid deal and the dangers of breaking it.

Isn't this just a ranger? No. You don't like nature, you just have to deal with it because it's your job. You kill animals or, at best, learn how to not anger them. Or maybe you did learn to like nature, in the years dealing with it. Doesn't mean it likes you back.

### Bonus Skills
You gain proficiency with Strength saving throws, *Survival* is added to your class skills and you gain 1 additional skill point to spend on the *Survival* skill.

### Master axeman
You are a master of axes, the pinnacle of weapons. It can be used as a weapon or as a tool, you can chop up firewood or orcs, it can be used for chopping, digging or hammering. There is no better weapon, nor tool. Gain 2 skill points to spend on tha *Axe* weapon group.

You may select a fighting style from the fighter class list and have access to that style as long as you are wielding an axe.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Expert Traveller
You suffer no penalties for sleeping in armor. If you are travelling alone, when travelling for an hour or more, difficult terrain does not slow your travel and you make all saving throws after a forced march at an advantage. Additionally, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

Beginning at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical terrain without being slowed by it and without taking damage from it if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

### Naturalist
Gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Animal Handling* skill.

Additionally, you can read the basic mood and intent of beasts. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it not to attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past week.

### Expedition Mastery
If you spend at least one day traveling in a specific type of terrain (arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark), you gain the following benefits until you spend at least an hour day traveling a different type of terrain.
* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travels.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* You remain alert to danger even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling, such as foraging, navigating, tracking, or mapping.

### Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Solid Like An Oak
You are as tough as the forest you work with. Whenever an effect requires you to make a Constitution saving throw, you may use your ***reaction*** to add 1d6 to the roll before the results of the roll have been announced. If succeeding on the Constitution saving throw would make you only take half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Natural Cartography
When outdoors, you can spend 10 minutes to study your nearby surroundings to extrapolate knowledge about the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. From a suitable vantage point with a high elevation and clear sightlines, you can accomplish this task in just 1 minute. This ability doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You gain knowledge of up to three facts about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area.

* terrain and bodies of water
* prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
* buildings

For example, you could determine the location of major sources of safe drinking water, the location of any nearby towns, and the location of goblin camps in the area.

### Unstoppable
Instead of rolling a saving throw, you can choose to count your result as a 20. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.

</div>

**Armor Techniques**

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Bladed Armor**. You install a pair of retractable blades on the bracers of your Well-fitted suit. Your blades are light, finesse weapons that deal 1d4 slashing or piercing damage that cannot be disarmed. You can hold or otherwise manipulate a weapon, shield, or other object on the same arm as your arm blade, though you cannot attack with your arm blade and use an object or weapon held in that hand on the same turn. You can also apply weapon technique to these arm blades as if they were your Well-balanced weapon.

- **Braced**. You smooth out and interlock the plates of your armor, and add a number of weights all around the suit, allowing you to lock your limbs and brace yourself for a coming impact. While wearing your this suit, as a ***reaction***, you can ignore a source of involuntary movement or avoid being knocked prone. Your suit must be heavy armor to accept this upgrade.

- **Cleats**. You install a set of spikes onto the front and rear of your armor's boots, giving you remarkable traction on even the roughest ground. While wearing your Well-fitted suit, you can move through difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain.

- **Hooked**. You add a series of discrete, retractable hooks to the gauntlets and boots of your armor. While wearing your Well-fitted suit, you gain a climb speed equal to your movement speed. Your suit must be light or medium armor to accept this upgrade.

- **Juggernaut Plating**. You install a set of heavy shoulder plates and a reinforced helmet on your armor, turning you into a veritable battering ram. While wearing your Well-fitted suit, you may, as an ***action***, move up to your speed towards an inanimate object. At the end of this movement, you hit the object, dealing 4d6 + twice your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, which ignores the object's damage threshold. Your suit must be heavy armor to accept Juggernaut Plating.

- **Reinforced**. You learn how to increase the toughness of your steel. While wearing your Well-fitted suit, you reduce all non-magical slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage by 2 points.

Your Well-fitted suit's maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 1, it no longer applies disadvantage on skill checks, and no longer imposes any penalty for sleeping in it.

- **Shining Armor**. When you roll initiative, the first hostile creature that sees you wearing your Well-fitted suit (or the nearest hostile creature, if multiple creatures can see you) must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage attacking any target other than you for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if you are knocked unconscious or the target loses sight of you. Any creature that succeeds this saving throw cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.

- **Spiked**. You add a layer of retractable spikes onto the knees, shoulders, gauntlets, helmet, and boots of your armor. While wearing your Well-fitted suit, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 piercing damage, and you may attack with them as if they were an off-hand weapon. Your suit must be medium or heavy armor to accept this upgrade.

- **Tempered**. Your Well-fitted suit has a number of fortification charges equal to your Wisdom modifier. When you are struck by a critical hit, your armor loses a fortification charge, and the critical hit becomes a regular hit. When there are no more fortification charges, this feature of your armor ceases to function. You regain all expended fortification charges when you finish a long rest.

</div>

**Weapon Techniques**

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Chained**. You attach long, light, flexible chain links from pommel of your weapon to a special bracer, allowing you to swing your weapon in a long, wide arc. This weapon becomes a reach weapon. If you are disarmed of your chained weapon, you can use a ***bonus action*** to pull it back to your hand.

- **Hooked**. Your weapon either ends with a long, curved hook, or has such a hook jutting out from one end. When you hit a creature with a hooked weapon, in lieu of dealing damage you can use your ***bonus action*** to attempt to shove the creature prone. When you do so, you make the check with advantage.

- **Serrated**. You cut out or forge in wickedly sharp teeth into the blade of our weapon, which cut deeply into unprotected flesh. A serrated weapon deals an additional 1d4 damage to any creature that is not wearing manufactured armor and has a natural Armor Class of 20 or less. You can only apply this technique to a weapon which deals slashing or piercing damage.

- **Spiked**. You fashion large, heavy spikes onto the business end of your weapon, allowing it to punch through armor. A spiked weapon deals an additional 1d4 damage to any creature that is wearing manufactured armor or has a natural Armor Class of greater than 20. You can only apply this technique to a weapon which deals bludgeoning or piercing damage.

- **Weighted**. You alloy a measure of lead into the steel of your weapon or inlay a core of steel into its haft. A weighted weapon weighs twice as much as it did before, becomes a heavy weapon, and loses the Light or Finesse properties if it had them. All of a weighted weapon's damage dice increase by 1 step (d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12), to a max of 1d12. You can only apply this technique to a melee weapon which is not heavy.
