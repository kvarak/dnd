# Rogue

Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck.

Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.


When brute force won’t get the job done, or when magic isn’t available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.

Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.

On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach — few rogues enjoy combat — with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue’s mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.

As a rogue, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Check your background for skills.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a rapier or *(b)* a shortsword
- *(a)* a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or *(b)* a shortsword
- *(a)* a burglar’s pack, *(b)* a dungeoneer’s pack, or *(c)* an explorer’s pack
- Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools

### Roguish Archetype
At 1st level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Sneak Attack
From 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.








### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to act quickly. You can take a ***bonus action*** on each of your turns to take the Disengage or Hide action, or to carefully aim your next attack, giving yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn.

### Expertise
At 3rd level, choose two of your skills (or tool proficiencies). Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make that uses either of the skills.

At 6th level, you can choose two additional skills.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to halve the attack’s damage against you.

### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you have advantage.





### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.



### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.






<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-RoguishArchetypes">Roguish Archetypes</a></h2>

Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **<a href="#internal-arcaneTrickster">Arcane Trickster</a>**. Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion.

- **<a href="#internal-assassin">Assassin</a>**. This archetype focuses its training on the grim art of death.

- **<a href="#internal-flyingBlade">Blade Juggler</a>**. Those who choose to fling handaxes, daggers, and the like from afar rather than partake in melee.

- **<a href="#internal-daggerspellMage">Daggerspell Mage</a>**. A master of blending the carnage of twin daggers with arcane spellcasting, daggerspell mages make devastating foes. To learn and perfect the art of balancing a spell on the edge of a blade takes years and must be practiced meticulously, but rewards it's students with exceptional power.

- **<a href="#internal-divineHerald">Divine Herald</a>**. A rogue with a calling as an unwavering and swift agent of divine retribution.

- **<a href="#internal-gambler">Gambler</a>**. While any fool can place a bet, Gamblers draw on luck and chance in all aspects of their adventures.

- **<a href="#internal-investigator">Investigator</a>**. Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon.

- **<a href="#internal-jester">Jester</a>**. Anything between a simple entertainer with an adventurous bent to a devotee to a trickster god, the jester has taken comedy to an art form.

- **<a href="#internal-keenBlade">Keen Blade</a>**. A specialist in knife fighting.

- **<a href="#internal-ruffian">Ruffian</a>**. Some rogues, especially those that are larger and  bulkier, favor a more direct approach than their lithe, graceful counterparts in the trade.

- **<a href="#internal-serpentineInfiltrator">Serpentine Infiltrator</a>**. A rogue that attunes to the serpentine shape-shifting powers of the Yuan-Ti.

- **<a href="#internal-spellwarpSniper">Spellwarp Sniper</a>**. Not content to splash around messy evocation magic to slay your foes, you have learned to alter the form of your spells into exact rays of lethal potential. Deadly and precise, you favor the methods of a surgeon, meticulously eradicating your foes, rather than the disorganized violence of a butcher.

- **<a href="#internal-thief">Thief</a>**. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Mage Hand Legerdemain
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast *mage hand*, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

* You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
* You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check. In addition, you can use the ***bonus action*** granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.








### Magical Ambush
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell.

### Versatile Trickster
At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your *mage hand*. As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you can designate a creature adjacent to the spectral hand. Doing so gives advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.

### Spell Thief
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your ***reaction*** to force the creature to make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability. The DC equals your spell save DC.



On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell, if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). Until your next long rest, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until you loose its use.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.










<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-assassin">Assassin</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies |
| 3rd | Assassinate |
| 9th | Infiltration Expertise |
| 13th | Impostor |
| 17th | Death Strike |

</div>

You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.


### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with burglary, disguise, poisons, sleight of hand and staying undetected.

### Assassinate
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Infiltration Expertise
Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.



### Impostor
At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any checks you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike
Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.






<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-flyingBlade">Blade Juggler</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies |
| 3rd | Throwing Expert |
| 9th | Doubletoss, Eyeball It |
| 13th | Throw Anything, Weak Spot |
| 17th | Pinpoint Focus |

</div>

Never ones to grow attached to weapons, Blade Jugglers are those who choose to fling handaxes, daggers, and the like from afar rather than partake in melee. Blade Jugglers have no qualms when it comes to parting with their weapons, for it is usually when another parts with his life. Notorious for their deadly precision, Blade Jugglers depend upon a keen eye and lightning reflexes to slay their foes from the shadows, preferring a deft throw over a flurry of blows.


### Bonus Proficiencies
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with all thrown weapons and perception checks.

### Throwing Expert
From 3rd level, the range for attacks made with thrown weapons is doubled. Additionally, you can draw or stow any number of weapons with the thrown and light properties when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

In addition, you have a number of tricks you can perform in battle to gain the upper hand.
* **Defensive Shot**. When a creature you can see within your weapon's short range makes an attack, before the attack roll you may use a ***reaction*** to make a ranged attack with your thrown weapon against that creature. If it hits the creature, the creature's attack is made with disadvantage.
* **Two With One Blow**. When you make an single attack during an attack action against a creature with a thrown weapon, you may attempt to make it ricochet to another creature within range of you. If the attack hits the first creature, roll an attack roll against the next creature. If it hits, you do not add your Dexterity bonus to the damage.
* **Interception**. When a creature makes a ranged attack against you, you may attempt to intercept the attack with one of your own, as a ***reaction*** you make a thrown weapon attack against the creature's attack, if your result is higher, you take no damage from the attack.



### Doubletoss
Your throws become more rapid, as you toss your weapons hand over hand. Starting at 9th level, whenever you make a thrown weapon attack with the Attack action, you may make an additional thrown weapon attack.

### Eyeball It
At 9th level, your eye for distance becomes flawless. You can accurately tell the distance between you and any point that you can see.

### Throw Anything
At 13th level, your mastery of thrown weapons has grown extensive. You can treat any weapon or item as a thrown weapon.

### Weak Spot
By level 13 you have developed a knack for targeting the weak spots in your opponent's armor. You can score critical hits on rolls of 19 or 20.

### Pinpoint Focus
When you reach level 17, you have become so precise that you are able to target the weakest and most sensitive parts of a creature. Using an ***action*** , you may make a ranged attack with a light thrown weapon. A creature who has succeeded on a save against an effect, is immune to that effect until aftrer your next long rest.

- **Pinpoint Focus DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier
- **Eyes.** On a hit, the target takes normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or become blinded. The creature is blinded until it is affected by a lesser restoration spell or a spell of similar effect.
- **Nerve Cluster**. On a hit, the target takes normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or become stunned. The creature remains stunned a number of rounds equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier. At the end of each of the target's subsequent turns, the creature makes another Constitution saving throw, ending the condition on a success.
- **Legs/Wings**. On a hit, the target takes normal damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature's movement speed is reduced by your proficiency bonus + your Dexerity or Strength modifier. On a failure, the creature falls prone and its movement speed is halved. This movement speed penalty lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier.
- **Throat.** On a hit, the target takes normal and and must make a Constitutions saving throw. On a success, the creature takes an additional damage die of damage. On a failure, the creature takes an additional damage equal to your sneak attack damage.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Imbue Dagger
At 3rd level, you can imbue your daggers with magical energies. As a ***bonus action*** you may imbue a dagger you are holding with a spell you know of first level or higher, expending a spell slot and spell components as though you cast the spell normally. You may only imbue spells with a duration of instantaneous. This dagger remains imbued so long as you maintain concentration on it.

When making an attack with an imbued dagger, treat it as a normal attack. If the attack successfully hits a creature, the spell is cast centered on your target or targeting only the creature hit by the dagger, as appropriate. Spells requiring spell attacks automatically hit, since the dagger has already struck the target. Line and cone spells are cast in the direction of the attack.

When using an imbued dagger to make a Sneak Attack, you may only apply half the number of d6 listed on the Sneak Attack table, rounded down, to the attack.








### Dagger Climbing
At 9th level, you can use your daggers to scale sheer walls. Climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you may climb on any surface regardless of whether or not it has handholds if your daggers can penetrate its surface.

### Absorb Dagger
At 13th level, you can harmless absorb your daggers (even if they are poisoned) into your hands as an ***action***. The concealed dagger cannot be detected even with a careful search (though it does radiate a transmutation aura under detect magic) and does not restrict your movement in any way. You may produce these daggers as a part of the Attack action.



### Greater Imbue Dagger
At 17th level, you may now imbue two held daggers instead of one as a ***bonus action***, expending spell slots for each separately, and concentrate on two imbued daggers at once.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Harbinger of Faith
Starting at 3rd level, your Sneak Attack can deal radiant damage instead of dealing the damage of the same type as your weapon. If you follow an evil deity, it deals necrotic damage instead.

Additionally you instill doubt in your target, causing it to question its convictions. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on the next attack it makes within 1 minute. You can use this feature an amount of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) and can regain uses after a long rest.








### Guise of the Believer
Starting at 9th level, your time spent among the zealous gives you impeccable insight into their mannerisms, speech patterns, and venerable demeanor, even outside of your religious affiliation.

When posing as a member of a religious organization, your identity is unquestioned by the masses. You have advantage on checks made against a discerning creature to expose your guise.

Additionally, you can instill further doubt in your target, granting them disadvantage in the contest with your posturing. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.

### Crosier of Penance
At 13th level, the fire of your faith makes you difficult to extinguish. When you are reduced to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If you succeed, you can immediately roll any number of Hit Dice and regain hit points equal to the result.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t cast a spell or use this feature again until you finish a long rest.



### Last Rites
At 17th level, when you hit a creature that has less than half its hit point, you can use your Sneak Attack feature on that creature, even without advantage.

</div>

While any fool can place a bet, Gamblers draw on luck and chance in all aspects of their adventures. Walking testaments to the phrase 'nothing ventured nothing gained,' these daring rogues are willing to risk more than most for the ultimate payoff.

Despite this ability to seize opportunities that most wouldn't be aware of, Gamblers know that for every roll of the die that lands in their favor, the next could just as easily leave them with nothing. Their abilities consist of random effects that are extremely powerful when successful, but detrimental if unsuccessful.

### Bonus Proficiencies
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with gambling, sleight of hand and checks made to decieve others.

### Gambler’s Tricks
In your time spent observing the highs and lows that lady luck brings with her, you have mastered certain techniques, known as Tricks, that can tip the odds in your favor, though at the risk of great misfortune.

At 3rd level, you gain two Tricks of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Your Trick options are detailed at the end of the class description. You learn an additional Trick at 9th level, 13th level, and 17th level.

Additionally, when you learn a new Trick, you can also replace a Trick that you know.

### Lucky Save
Starting at 3rd level, whenever you roll a 20 on a saving throw you can use your ***reaction*** to immediately make an attack or move your speed.

### Fate’s Fortune
Beginning at 9th level, as an ***action***, you can ask the powers of fate one question about a possible course of action. In your mind you receive guidance as to what the most rewarding course of action is. If you describe courses of action that refer to directions or specific objects, then you become aware of the choice that bears the greatest reward.



If you describe only a single course of action, fate assumes that inaction is your other option. You will feel a desire to continue (to indicate that you should proceed) or a sense you should halt. The feeling can’t assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If unable indicate a preference, this feature has no effect and is not expended.

There are two drawbacks to using the feature to aid your decisions. First, fate values rewards over risk, and provides guidance accordingly. It points you toward a high risk, high reward option before pointing you toward a low risk, low reward alternative.

Second, fate can choose only the most rewarding course of action relative to the alternatives provided. That doesn’t mean that the indicated choice is necessarily a good idea, only that it’s a better idea than the other options you’ve indicated.

You regain the use of this feature after finishing a long rest.



## Tricks

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Beginner’s Luck
    When you roll an ability check for a skill you are not proficient with, you can gain advantage on that roll. However, you have disadvantage on all future ability checks made using that skill until you finish a long rest.

- #### Borrowed Luck
    When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, you can reroll the die. Alternatively, when a critical hit is scored against you, you can choose to reroll that die and must use the new roll. After doing so, the next critical hit you make before a long rest instead counts as a normal hit. You regain use of this feature after a short rest.

- #### Breaking Even
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, choose one creature you can see. For the next minute, whenever you hit the target with an attack you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). However, whenever you miss the target you take damage equal to the same amount. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a short rest.

- #### Card Streak
    *Prerequisite: 17th level*

    As an action, you can hurl conjured, razorsharp cards in a 30 foot cone. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw with a saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d10 slashing damage, or half as much on a successful one. Cards created by this ability are solid and convincing, but vanish after 1 hour. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a long rest.

- #### Chance Dice
    You have three chance dice, which are d6s. A chance die is expended when you use it. Before making an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can expend any number of these dice to grant either a bonus or penalty to your roll. If the total number on the chance dice rolled is odd, you must subtract that amount from your d20 roll. If it's even, you must add that amount. You regain all of your expended chance dice when you finish a short rest.

- #### Cheaters Sometimes Prosper
    When you are adjacent to a creature that has no other creatures next to it, you can use a ***reaction*** to make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Insight. If successful, you gain advantage on all weapon attacks you make against the target before the start of your next turn. If you fail, you have disadvantage instead.

- #### Double or Nothing
    After you hit with a weapon attack, choose odds or evens. If the total number on your damage dice matches your choice you can apply double the damage rolled. However, on an incorrect result your damage is halved (rounded down). You regain the use of this feature after finishing short rest.

- #### Even the Odds
    When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you can use your ***reaction*** to influence the outcome. Roll 1d6, and either add or subtract the result from the triggering roll. After doing so, the next time the target makes the same roll before a long rest, it instead does the opposite. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a short rest.

- #### High Roller
    *Prerequisite: 13th level*

    When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, but do not score a critical hit, you can try to attempt to turn it into one. Starting with the number shown on the triggering attack roll, choose higher or lower and roll the dice again. If you successfully guess the outcome twice in a row, the original attack becomes a critical hit. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a short rest.

- #### Jinx
    You learn and can cast the spell *hex* without expending a spell slot or spell components. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

- #### Lucky Seven
    *Prerequisite: 17th level*

    Your weapon attacks can score a critical hit on a roll of 7 or 20.

- #### Risky Roulette
    *Prerequisite: 13th level*

    When you make an attack roll, you can choose odds or evens. If the attack hits and you guessed the result of the attack roll correctly, the target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn. If you missed and you guessed the result of the attack roll incorrectly, you are incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a short rest.

- #### Shared Luck
    Whenever you score a critical hit, one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you can gain advantage on their next attack roll, skill check or saving throw.

- #### Slots
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    Whenever you roll sneak attack damage, if 3 or more of the sneak attack dice have the same result, you can deal additional damage equal to that amount. You can only apply this to 1 trio of results per sneak attack.

- #### Spin the Wheel
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    After you hit a creature with a weapon attack, as well as rolling damage normally you can choose to roll a d8 and apply the corresponding effect. You regain the use of this feature after finishing a short rest.

    | d8 | Effect |
    |:-:|:-------------|
    | 1 | You take damage equal to half the damage you dealt to the creature. |
    | 2 | You are slowed until the end of your next turn and cannot take reactions. |
    | 3 | You fall prone. |
    | 4 | No additional effect. |
    | 5 | You gain advantage on your next attack roll against the target.|
    | 6 | You deal extra damage to the target equal to your Charisma modifier. |
    | 7 | You can immediately make another attack against the target with advantage. |
    | 8 | The target is paralyzed until the beginning of your next turn. |


- #### When the Chips Are Down
    *Prerequisite: 17th level*

    When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You may also, as a ***reaction***, move up to twice your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

</div>

Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they're in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.

Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as spies, advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed.

### Sixth Sense
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying and avoiding ambushes. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

    You can cast spells from scrolls, even if you do not have them on a known spell list, or even if you cannot cast spells at all.

- #### Broad knowledge
    You gain proficiency in one artisan's tool of your choice. You also can choose to gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, Medicine orReligion.

- #### Ceaseless Observation
    Your ability to notice the minutiae of almost everything that happens around you allows you to make shrewd and insightful calculations about people. You can use your Intelligence modifier instead of the skill's typical ability for all Insight, Medicine and Persuasion checks.

- #### Deduction
    By spending an ***action*** in thoughtful examination, you can deduce a frightening amount of information about your opponents. With a successful Intelligence check you expose the failings of your enemies with terrifying clarity. For each creature in sight, for which its CR is below the result of your Intelligence check, you learn their immunities, weaknesses and resistances.

- #### Dismantle

You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.

Once you have studied an area, you can attempt a Dexterity (Investigation) check to alter or conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 x 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed check against the result of your Investigation check or accept the altered scene as truth.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-jester">Jester</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Harlequin's Mask |
| 3rd | Arcane Buffoonery |
| 9th | Cruel Comedy |
| 13th | Jesting Magician |
| 17th | Last Trick |

</div>

Comedy is an art form that some few study with an almost religious zeal, honing their words and their blades with endless practice and performance. Some that style themselves as jesters are simple entertainers with an adventurous bent, while others are genuine devotees of trickster deities such as Garl Glittergold, Avandra, or the Laughing God Who Has No Temples, and consider their jesting a holy calling of sorts.

Regardless, a jester is a student of life, emotion, and culture, and appreciates both the highs and lows afforded to mortals by the conditions in which they live. A jester observes and comments, always knowing the right word or phrase to get a laugh, a tear, a bellow of murderous rage, or to simply swing the opinions of others their way.


### Bonus Proficiencies
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with acrobatics, disguise and performance.

### Harlequin's Mask
Also from 1st level, you may, as an ***item action***, either don a mask in your possession with traditional harlequin markings, or apply facepaint from your disguise kit to achieve a similar effect. In either case, while wearing your Harlequin's Mask you have advantage on any check to specifically cause a distraction or otherwise draw attention to yourself.

### Arcane Buffoonery
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast a variety of spells as part of your jesting. You learn the cantrips *vicious mockery*, *prestidigitation*, and *minor illusion*.

You also learn three of the following spells: *Tasha's hideous laughter*, *illusory script*, *color spray*, *faerie fire*, *feather fall* and *jump*.

If you choose to know the *jump* spell, it may only be cast with yourself as a target when using this feature.




You may cast the spells that you know from this feature once each per short rest, as if you had used a 1st level spell slot. These spells may only be cast or channelled while wearing your Harlequin's Mask.

While wearing your mask, you may cast the *vicious mockery* cantrip as a ***bonus action*** on your turn. When cast in this way, *vicious mockery* deals no damage.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for any spell you receive from this archetype.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Cruel Comedy
Starting at 9th level, your aptitude with the art of jesting gains more refinement, and your comedic barbs become ever more brutal and merciless. Whenever an enemy fails its save against your *vicious mockery*, the first attack you make against that enemy before the end of your next turn has advantage.

In addition, while wearing your Harlequin's Mask you are immune to being charmed.

### Jesting Magician
At 13th level, your repertoire of inherent magical knowledge expands to include several more mischevious tricks. You learn three of the following spells: *cloud of daggers, calm emotions, misty step, enthrall, mirror image, crown of madness, spider climb, feign death*, and *rope trick*.

You may cast the spells that you know from this feature once, as if you had used a 2nd level spell slot. If you choose to know *feign death* or *spider climb*, they may only be cast with yourself as a target when using this feature.

In addition, the spells you have received from the Arcane Buffoonery feature may now be cast as if they were using 2nd level spell slots. Spells from either of these features may only be cast or channelled while wearing your Harlequin's Mask.








### Last Trick
Starting at 17th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead and place yourself under the effects of a false death identical to the *feign death* spell. On your turn you can end this effect with no additional action.

When you end this effect, you have advantage on any attack that targets a creature which believed you were dead, until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the first attack you make that hits such a creature before the end of your next turn automatically benefits from your Sneak Attack feature, and deals an extra 4d6 damage of your weapon’s type.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

# <a name="internal-keenBlade">Keen Blade</a>
In a quick flurry of steel, you deceive and tear your opponents down in the blink of an eye. You weave and dodge until you see the perfect opening, and if there is not an opening, you make one. Daggers are your weapon of choice, only they offer the surgical precision guided by your true weapon. Off the battlefield your daggers may be sheathed but your true weapon is still drawn; your true power is your intelligence and your ability to read the environment and those around you. Your mind is the true unseen weapon, your tactics cut deeper than any blade, sharper than any edge. You are a Keen Blade.

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Unfettered Defense |
| 3rd | Combat Superiority |
| 9th | Brilliant Awareness, Know Your Enemy |
| 13th | Cunning Combat |
| 17th | Flow of Combat |

### Unfettered Defense
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier when wearing no armor.

### Combat Superiority
Keen blades distinguish them with particular tactics that use their powers of analysis, deception, and precision. Starting at 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d6s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 9th level and one more at 13th level.

#### Using Superiority Dice
You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

 **Feinting Attack**. You can expend a superiority die and use a ***bonus action*** choosing an adjacent creature as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage.

 **Inveigle**. When you make any Charisma check or Insight check, you may expend a superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.



 **Bleeding Attack**. When you damage a creature with a dagger, you may expend a superiority die. Your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If it fails, at the start of each of it turns it takes 1d4 damage for a number of rounds equal to your roll on the superiority die. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, the duration is extended by that many rounds.

 **Tactical Advantage**. When you roll initiative you may expend a superiority die to add it to the result of the roll to your initiative. In addition, you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet.

### Brilliant Awareness
Your experience and your intellect push your perception to a near superhuman level. Starting at 9th level, you add your intelligence bonus any Perception and Insight checks.

### Know Your Enemy
Your understanding of others grows to extent where you can tell a lot about someone just by studying them. Also from 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to the following characteristics:
* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels (if any)

# <a name="internal-ruffian">Ruffian</a>
Some rogues, especially those that are larger and  bulkier, favor a more direct approach than their lithe, graceful counterparts in the trade. Ruffians make a living as criminal enforcers, extorting the proprietors of their honest earnings in exchange for “protection”. If met with resistance, they usually begin by breaking a few objects, and failing that, breaking a few kneecaps - using the first available piece of merchandise at hand to do so.

##### Ruffian Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:-----------:|:--------|
| 1st | Crush ‘Em |
| 3rd | Dirty Fighting
| 9th | Shakedown
| 13th | Send ‘Em to the Hospital
| 17th | Send ‘Em to the Morgue

### Crush ‘Em
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with one-handed clubs, flails, hammers and maces, as well as improvised weapons similar to these weapons. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d3 damage.

While wielding any of these weapons or making an unarmed strike:
* You can make a Sneak Attack even if the weapon lacks the Finesse property.
* When you hit an object, you deal an additional damage to it equal to half your rogue level.

### Dirty Fighting
At 3rd level, when you make a Sneak Attack against a creature no more than 1 size category larger than you, and using a Crush ‘Em weapon, you can use a your ***Cunning Action*** to perform a Low Blow.

Some effects require the target to make a saving throw. A target that has failed on a save against a Low Blow, is immune to the same effect until its next long rest.

 **Low Blow save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus  + your Strength Modifier




You learn the following Low Blows.

 **Blind/Deafen**. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are blinded until the end of your next turn, or deafened for up to 1 minute (your choice). If deafened, the target makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

 **Hamstring**. The target makes a Strength saving throw. If they fail, their movement speed is reduced by half for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the target regains any missing hit points.

 **Knockdown**. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they are knocked prone. If the target attempts to stand up within your reach, you can use your ***reaction*** to make an attack of opportunity against them.

 **Stagger**. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature loses its reaction and spends its action on its next turn retching or reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

### Shakedown
At 9th level, you add two-handed clubs and hammers to your list of available Crush ‘Em weapons, and while holding a Crush ‘Em weapon, you have advantage on Intimidation checks.

### Send ‘Em to the Hospital
At 13th level, you can rough up anything or anyone you can get your hands on. When grappling a creature, you can use your Cunning Action to use that creature as an improvised shield, granting a +2 bonus to your Armor Class.

If an attack misses you, you can use your ***reaction*** to cause the grappled creature to become the target of the attack.

### Send ‘Em to the Morgue
At 17th level, you can make the most of a nearby opponent’s failures. When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to attack it with a Crush ‘Em weapon. If it hits, this revenging blow deals an additional 3d6 damage, and you can choose to immediately perform one Low Blow against your attacker.









# <a name="internal-serpentineInfiltrator">Serpentine Infiltrator</a>
In dark jungles forgotten by mankind dwell the yuan-ti. Insidious snake folk with the ambition to control civilizations like a puppeteer their mannequin, they are masters of deception and infiltration. A serpentine infiltrator is a rogue who has obtained a small taste of the power of a yuan-ti. Perhaps you were educated by a yuan-ti to operate as a spy in other lands. Perhaps you were bitten by one and the venom did not kill you, instead passing on the mysterious powers of the serpent. Perhaps you trained to learn the art of the reptile in order to hunt down those that use it. Whatever the case, you are a master manipulator and talented shape shifter.

Some of the Serpentine Infiltrators abilities require the enemy to make a saving throw. If they do, the DC of this check is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies |
| 3rd | Viper Form |
| 9th | Venomous Fangs |
| 13th | Finish the Feeble, Poison Mist |
| 17th | Gaze of the Medusa |

### Bonus Proficiencies
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with deception, disguise, poisons and staying undetected, as well as on checks for handling snakes.

### Viper Form
At 3rd level you gain the ability to transform into a viper. While in viper form you replace your stat block with that of a viper, with the following exceptions:

* You retain your hp. Any damage you suffer in viper form carries over to your human form, and vice versa.
* You retain all your rogue abilities. However, you cannot sneak attack with your natural weapons while in viper form.
* You retain the same Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores you have in your humanoid form.

If you are slain or knocked unconscious as a viper, you immediately return to your humanoid form. If there is not enough room in the area to return to humanoid form, you instead remain in your viper form but are immediately slain.



### Venomous Fangs
At 9th level you gain a pair of snake fangs even in your humanoid form. They are retractable and unnoticeable unless you are using them to before an attack.

As an ***action*** you may make an attempt to bite an enemy with your fangs. If the attack hits, that enemy takes 1d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution Save or be poisoned for i minute.

You may use this ability in both your humanoid form and viper form. You may apply your sneak attack damage to the bite if applicable, even in viper form.

### Finish the Feeble
At 13th level you have advantage on your attack rolls against poisoned enemies.

### Poison Mist
At 13th level you gain the ability to spit out a thick poisonous mist in both your humanoid and viper form as an ***action***.

A 15 ft cube is covered in a poisonous mist. The mist obscures vision, and all creatures not resistant to poison that start their turn in the mist must succeed at a Constitution Save or take 3d6 poison damage and be poisoned for until the end of your next turn.

The mist lasts for 1d6 rounds. If two clouds of mist overlap, any creatures inside multiple clouds are only affected by one.

### Gaze of the Medusa
At 17th level you learn the ultimate serpentine skill - the petrification of enemies. As an ***action***, you may gaze at an enemy within 60 feet. If the enemy can see you, they must succeed on a Constitution save or take 10d6 poison damage and be Poisoned for one minute. If the enemy succeeds on their save they take half damage and are not Poisoned. If the enemy is already Poisoned and they fail their save, they are Petrified.

Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

# <a name="internal-spellwarpSniper">Spellwarp Sniper</a>
You are more accurate with rays of flame than an archer is with his arrows, and twice as deadly. Not content to splash around messy evocation magic to slay your foes, you have learned to alter the form of your spells into exact rays of lethal potential. Deadly and precise, you favor the methods of a surgeon, meticulously eradicating your foes, rather than the disorganized violence of a butcher.

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|

The Spellwarp Sniper Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.

#### Spells Known
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and illusion spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Spellwarp Sniper Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation and illusion, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation and illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

When you cast a spell of duration instantaneous that affects an area, you may change that spell's range to a single target with a range of 60 feet.

# <a name="internal-thief">Thief</a>
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

#### Archetype Features
| Rogue Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies |
| 3rd | Fast Hands, Second-Story Work |
| 9th | Supreme Sneak |
| 13th | Use Magic Device |
| 17th | Thief's Reflexes |

### Bonus Proficiencies
Beginning when you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with athletics, burglary, sleight of hand and staying undetected.

When climbing, you can always use Dexterity instead of Strength.

### Fast Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your ***Cunning Action*** to make a sleight of hand check, disarm a trap, open a lock, or take the ***item action***.



### Second-Story Work
Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

### Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on stealth checks if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

### Use Magic Device
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You gain the Arcana skill, and ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

### Thief's Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised
