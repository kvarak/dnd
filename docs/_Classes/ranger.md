# Ranger
For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game — even fugitives among their own people.


#### Character Creation
Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.

A relationship with civilization informs every ranger’s personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization’s frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.

Why did you choose the path of a ranger. In the following table are some suggestions, but keep in mind your background and all the other details you have established so far.




#### Ranger Background
| d6 | I became a ranger because … |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | I found purpose while I honed my hunting skills by bringing down dangerous animals at the edge of civilization. |
| 2 | I always had a way with animals, able to calm them with a soothing word and a touch. |
| 3 | I suffer from terrible wanderlust, so being a ranger gave me a reason not to remain in one place for too long. |
| 4 | I have seen what happens when the monsters come out from the dark. I took it upon myself to become the first line of defense against the evils that lie beyond civilization’s borders. |
| 5 | I met a grizzled ranger who taught me woodcraft and the secrets of the wild lands. |
| 6 | I served in an army, learning the precepts of my profession while blazing trails and scouting enemy encampments.  |

</div>

As a ranger, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Strength

**Skills:** Check your background for skills. In addition you gain proficiency with three of the following: Animal Handling, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Surviving in the wilds or Tracking

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* scale mail or *(b)* leather armor
* *(a)* two shortswords or *(b)* two simple melee weapons
* *(a)* a dungeoneer’s pack or *(b)* an explorer’s pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows


### Natural Explorer
You are particularly familiar with the natural world, adept at traveling and surviving out in the wilds. At 1st level, choose three of the following traits. You may choose two additional traits at 6th and 10th level.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Expert Tracker
    While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and roughly how long ago it was that they passed through the area.

- #### Forest Friend
    You gain the trust of a tiny animal friend. You both share a basic understanding, though the animal is still subject to its natural instincts. Your animal must be a tiny CR 0 beast, and (when relevant) it shares your pool of actions.

    If your animal friend is reduced to 0 hit points, you can spend one hit die or suffer a level of exhaustion to reduce it to 1 hit point instead. If your animal friend leaves or dies, you can spend time during a long rest to try bonding with another creature from the surrounding environment.

    Unless abused, this friend will have some degree of DM protection.

    **Many Friends**: You may take this trait multiple times, gaining an additional animal friend each time.

- #### In the Corner of My Eye
    Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.


- #### Light in the Dark
    You know how to make your lighting supplies last a little longer in the dark. You may roll with advantage when crafting (or enhancing) simple candles or torches, and these crafted lights burn for twice as long as normal.

- #### Light Sleeper
    While asleep, you are still half-aware of what's happening around you. You may still roll Perception checks while sleeping, but with disadvantage.

- #### Make a Meal out of Everything
    You may roll with advantage when attempting to cook a simple meal with basic or improvised ingredients.

- #### Natural Sense of Direction
    When travelling outside, you may make navigation checks as if you had a map and compass.

- #### Shortcut to Mushrooms
    When you forage, you find twice as much food or water as you normally would.

- #### There is Always Another Path
    Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group's travel during long journeys.

- #### Walk Softly and Carry a Big Bow
    If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

</div>


### Sworn Enemy
At 1st level, you swear an oath to protect the world against a particular type of enemy. Choose one of the following options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Favored Archetype
    Choose one of the following enemy archetypes: warrior, mage, mindless, minion, brute, primordial, trickster, flyer, stalker, fiend, or legend. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks to track enemies of that archetype, and you deal an additional 1 damage when you hit them with a weapon attack.

    **Brute**. The enemy has a Strength score of 17 or higher or is of size Large or larger.

    **Fiend**. The enemy is a fiend, or it serves, worships, or draws power from a fiend.

    **Flyer**. The enemy has a flying speed.

    **Legend**. The enemy is CR 15 or higher, has the Legendary Resistance feature, or has legendary actions.

    **Mage**. The enemy has the Spellcasting feature or wields a magic item that isn't armour or a weapon.

    **Mindless**. The enemy has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, or it is enchanted to act against its will.

    **Minion**. The enemy is of CR 1/2 or lower, or it has less than 20 hit points maximum.

    **Stalker**. The enemy has proficiency in Stealth or has the False Appearance trait.

    **Warrior**. The enemy wields a martial weapon or uses a shield.

    This option improves at 6th level.

- #### Favored Enemy
    You have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.

    Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type.

    Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

    When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.

    This option improves at 3rd and 6th level.

- #### Favored Foe
    You can mark one creature as your favored enemy for a time: you can cast the *hunter’s mark* spell without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, *hunter’s mark* doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

- #### Honed Instinct
    Your keen senses allow you to take advantage of the chaos that ensues when a fight breaks out. You are proficient with initiative and have advantage on initiative checks. On your first round during combat, you have advantage on attack and damage rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

</div>

<div class="card rest">
<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Long rest |
|:-|
| After a long rest: |
| * Regain one use of ***Primeval Awareness***.
| Add the following class specific benefits to choose from: |
| * Regain all uses of ***Favored Foe***.
| * Regain all uses of ***Primeval Awareness***.
| * Regain all uses of ***Fade Away***.

</div>
</div>
</div>


### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options from the <a href="fighter.html#internal-FightingStyles">fighter list of fighting styles</a>. You can’t take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

### Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid.

#### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from your spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.


#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Primeval Awareness
From 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a link to beasts and to the land around you.

You have an ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs, and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked.

#### Favored Enemy
If you have the Favored Enemy feature, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 minute in concentration, you sense whether any such enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which type of enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles) from you. If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Ranger Conclave
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Greater Sworn Enemy
At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Depending on which Sworn Enemy you selected at 1st level, you gain the following feature:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Favored Archetype
    You can choose either to specialise in an additional enemy archetype or to upgrade an archetype you already specialise in.

    **Brute**. Brutes suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls against you.

    **Fiend**. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to detect if a creature serves, worships, or draws power from a fiend.

    **Flyer**. When you hit a flyer with an attack, it looses flight until the start of your next turn.

    **Legend**. You deal 3 extra damage per hit against legends, instead of 1.

    **Mage**. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws against spells.

    **Mindless**. Mindless creatures avoid attacking you unless you have damaged them or they have been given an explicit order to attack you.

    **Minion**. Once per turn, when you kill a minion, you can transfer any excess damage from your attack to another minion within 5 feet of the first minion. The second minion has resistance to this damage.

    **Stalker**. Your Perception is considered to be 5 higher for the purpose of detecting stalkers, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to search for them if you know they are nearby (suspicion or paranoia is insufficient).

    **Warrior**. You have resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons.

- #### Favored Enemy
    You may choose a greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.

    Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

- #### Favored Foe or Honed Instinct
    You may select a Favored Enemy from any creature type in the 1st level Favored enemy feature. However, you will only gain the benefits described in the 1st level feature.

</div>

### Relentless
At 8th level you can choose one of the following options:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Relentless Pursuit
    You can use the Dash action as a ***bonus action*** on your turn. Also, you have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws to avoid exhaustion during chases and forced marches.

- #### Relentless Wanderer
    You have advantage on any saving throw made to avoid non magical traps or natural hazards, as well as resistance to any damage from non magical traps or natural hazards. You don’t gain this benefit if you are incapacitated, grappled, or restrained.

</div>

### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 10th level, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. If you remain motionless while hiding, creatures that attempt to detect you take a −10 penalty to their Perception checks.

### Low Profile
Starting at 14th level, you are no more remarkable in your element than a small animal or an insect, able to slip by almost anyone unnoticed. Choose one of the following features:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Fade Away
    You can use a ***bonus action*** to magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.

    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest

- #### Vanish
    You can use the Hide action as a ***bonus action*** on each of your turns in combat. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

</div>

### Evolutionary Balance
At 18th level, you gain a special ability to detect your prey. Choose one of the following options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Eagle's Eyes
    You can see objects and creatures up to 1 mile away as though they were directly in front of you. When you are at least 120 feet above the ground, this range increases to 10 miles.

    You become proficient with Perception if you weren't already, and you add double your proficiency bonus, instead of your normal bonus, when you make Perception checks.

- #### Feral Senses
    You gain supernatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.

- #### Hound's Snout
    You can detect the scent of all creatures that passed through an area unless the area has been subject to light winds for 1 hour, moderate winds for 1 minute, or strong winds for 1 round. By following the scent trail, you can detect the exact path your quarry took.

    In addition, you can expend a spell slot to improve your sense of smell even further and work out events that transpired in a specific location within 60 feet of you. You can identify specific people (as long as you are familiar with their scent), their movements, and how they interacted with the environment, up to the DM's discretion.

</div>

### Apex Predator
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Choose an option.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Foe Slayer
    Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

- #### Roots of the Arcane
    Once per turn, when you spend a 1st level spell slot on your turn, you regain a 1st level spell slot.

- #### Swift Hunter
    On your first turn during combat, any of your attacks that hits a creature who has not yet acted is a critical hit.

- #### Whirlwind
    Once per turn, you can trade one of your attacks to do a whirlwind. When doing a whirlwind, you make one melee weapon attack against each creature within 5 feet of you.

</div>





<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-conclaves">Ranger Conclaves</a></h2>

</div>





<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-beastMaster">Beast Conclave</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Animal Companion |
| 5th | Coordinated Attack |
| 7th | Beast’s Defense |
| 11th | Storm of Claws and Fangs |
| 15th | Superior Beast’s Defense |

</div>

Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beast Conclave develop a close bond with a beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic.



### Animal Companion
At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

With 8 hours of preparation, you call forth an animal from the surrounding wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.

At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call return your animal companion to life, with 1 hp.

If you use this ability to call upon a new companion, your current companion leaves you.

<div class="infoarea">

##### Expanding Companion Options
Depending on the nature of your campaign, the DM might choose to expand the options for your animal companion. As a rule of thumb, a beast can serve as an animal companion if it is Medium or smaller, has 15 or fewer hit points, and cannot deal more than 8 damage with a single attack. In general, that applies to creatures with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less, but there are exceptions.


</div>

#### Companion’s Bond
Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.
 * The companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
 * It obeys your commands as best it can. The companion rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.
 * Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, it also adds its proficiency bonus to AC and damage rolls.
 * Your animal companion gains becomes proficient with all saving throws.
 * For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
 * Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can  roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”
 * If you have the Favored Archetype or Favored Enemy feature, your animal companion gains those benefits, as well as the improved features when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.
 * When your beast companion falls to 0 hit points, it gains the Dying condition as if it were a player character. Roll death saving throws for the companion when appropriate.


| d6 | Trait |
|:--:|:------|
| 1 | I’m dauntless in the face of adversity. |
| 2 | Threaten my friends, threaten me. |
| 3 | I stay on alert so others can rest. |
| 4 | People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage. |
| 5 | I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time. |
| 6 | I put my friends’ needs before my own in all things. |



| d6 | Flaw |
|:--:|:------|
| 1 | If there’s food left unattended, I’ll eat it. |
| 2 | I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me. |
| 3 | Any time is a good time for a belly rub. |
| 4 | I’m deathly afraid of water. |
| 5 | My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face. |
| 6 | I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them. |









### Coordinated Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you and your animal companion form a more potent fighting team. When you use the Attack action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its ***reaction*** to make a melee attack.

### Beast’s Defense
At 7th level, while your companion can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.



### Storm of Claws and Fangs
At 11th level, your companion can use its ***action*** to make a melee attack against each creature of its choice within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### Superior Beast’s Defense
At 15th level, whenever an attacker that your companion can see hits it with an attack, it can use its ***reaction*** to halve the attack’s damage against it






<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-burghalExplorer">Burghal Explorer</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Burghal Explorer Magic, Grazing Strike |
| 5th | Extra Attack |
| 7th | Above and Below |
| 11th | Streetwise |
| 15th | Close Quarters |

</div>

Burghal Explorers are at home in tight places, making their living as urban bounty hunters or guiding magical search crews through dangerous ruins. Dark slums and ruined cities, choked with thirsty weeds and decorated with crumbling remnants of once-thriving communities, become gathering points for desperate innocents—and for sneak-thieves and bandits who prey on the helpless.

Burghal Explorers toe the line between the natural forest and cityscapes, moonlighting as vigilantes, or fending off unnatural horrors that reach covetously toward the darkest, deepest, plots of land.

> *"Ranging doesn’t just happen in the wilderness. It happens in ancient ruins, dank caves, and crowded cities. The towers are my mountains, the allies are my forest, and the criminal scum is my quarry."*
>
> -- Landon Fleetcloak, Burghal explorer




### Burghal Explorer Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Burghal Explorer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it does not count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Burghal Explorer Spells
| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | *find familiar* |
| 5th | *misty step* |
| 9th | *tongues* |
| 13th | *Mordenkainen’s faithful hound* |
| 17th | *animate objects* |




### Grazing Strike
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to hinder your foes with your strikes. Once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can graze your target’s arm, leg, chest, or head. When you do, the creature takes an additional 1d4 damage and you impose one of the follow effects on that target:
* **Head**. It has disadvantage the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.
* **Arm**. It has disadvantage on the next Strength or Dexterity check it makes before the end of its next turn.
* **Leg**. Its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
* **Chest**. It must succeed a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 5 feet away from you.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Above and Below
At 7th level, you can identify the fastest routes across cityscapes or crumbling ruins, whether the path leads through the sewers below or the roofs above. Climbing and swimming no longer costs you extra movement and you can hold your breath for twice as long as normal.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

### Streetwise
At 11th level, you disappear into crowds without hesitation. While you are hidden, moving through a crowd that isn’t hostile to you, you can don a disguise if you have prepared it in advance and you have at least one hand free.

### Close Quarters
At 15th level, you always gain the benefits of half cover whenever two or more creatures are within 5 feet of you. As a ***bonus action*** while holding a shield, you can grant this to benefit to one of the creatures adjacent to you until the start of your next turn or it moves 10 feet away from you.

</div>

Diabolist rangers roam the land, searching for tales of shades that hunt for the living, banshees that haunt the woods, or even helping ghosts that are not aware that they have passed in the first place. They believe that the ethereal creatures that we may become should be helped to pass on to a proper plane of existence, or at the very least stopped from harming others.



### Diabolist Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Diabolist Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Diabolist Spells
| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | *detect evil and good* |
| 5th | *gentle repose* |
| 9th | *magic circle* |
| 13th | *death ward* |
| 17th | *dispel evil and good* |


### Phantom Sense
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of ethereal undead creatures. As an ***action***, you detect the location of the closest ethereal undead creature within 100 ft of you. You learn the CR of the creature, but not the exact type of the creature.

### Mind Impression
Also at 3rd level, you can enhance your knowledge of the afterlife to whittle away the psyche of others. As a ***bonus action***, you designate one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes psychic damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage from the attack.

When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d6.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Spiritual Sheath
Starting at 7th level, you are well versed in the effects that the supernatural creatures can cause. You have advantage on any saving throw from undead creatures' special abilities, for example a ghost’s Possession or a specter’s Life Drain feature.

### Planar Blockade
At 11th level, you can sense when a creature attempts to move out of this plane or travel and attempt to block it. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you attempts to teleport or use a feature to travel to another plane, similar to the *plane shift* spell, you can use your ***reaction*** to cause the target creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s attempt fails.

### Material Slip
Finally at 15th level, you can alter your form to match the creatures you fight. As a ***bonus action***, you can magically transform yourself into a semi-ethereal form, one between the material plane and a spirit. While you are like this, you have resistance to all damage from creatures that are not ethereal, except for force damage. You do not have resistance from any creature that is ethereal.

While in this form, you can move in any direction, including up and down, or through objects as difficult terrain. If you end your turn in an object, you take 10 force damage. You remain in this form for 1 minute. This feature ends early if you use a ***bonus action*** to do so, you fall unconscious, you die, or if you enter an area of antimagic.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

</div>

A fey hunter specializes in eliminating menaces from the Fey Realms and resisting the many charms and deceptions of the fey. Though fey hunters need not slay every fey they meet, alliances between the fair folk and their hunters are fleeting and uneasy.


### Fey Hunter Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Hunter Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Sealed Mind
At 3rd level, you become vigilant against the wiles of the fey. You become proficient with Wisdom saving throws, nad you have advantage on saves against being charmed.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Rally Against Fey
From 7th level, when an ally within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an enchantment spell, you can use your ***reaction*** to allow that ally to reroll the saving throw and take the higher result. You cannot use this feature on yourself.

### Lift the Veil
Starting at 11th level, your strikes cut away at the magic surrounding your prey. When you take the Attack action and damage your target, you can use your ***bonus action*** to immediately end any one spell of 3rd level or lower affecting the target. You must know what effect you want to end, e.g. you could choose to end whatever is making your foe invisible, not necessarily knowing the exact spell causing the effect.

Additionally, as an ***action***, you may expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to gain truesight to a range of 60 ft. The duration requires concentration and lasts until the end of your next round (2nd level slot), 1 minute (3rd level slot), 10 minutes (4th level slot), or 1 hour (5th level slot).

### Master Fey Hunter
At 15th level, your attacks and spells against fey creatures ignore any resistances they possess. Additionally, you can now end spells of 5th level or lower when using your Lift the Veil feature.

| 5th | Extra Attack |
| 7th | Evasive Fighter |
| 11th | Hit Hard, Hit Fast |
| 15th | Nimble Dodge |

</div>

Agile, evasive, and unmoored from the constraints that slow down other rangers, the archetypal freerunner is supremely nimble and capable of crossing terrain as quickly as possible. They accomplish this through a skilled combination of dashing, leaping, and nimbly climbing, that guides them down clever paths through their environments. Moreover, an adept freerunner can convert the momentum from their gymnastics into deadly force, crushing their enemies with exceptional impact from unexpected directions.

A freerunner is most at home in a city or in the treetops of a great forest, for their unique movement requires a place that is steeped with complex geometry which reaches high into the sky. Of course, even on flat terrain, a freerunner's agility is not to be underestimated, for they can dive through a giants legs or scurry up its back with ease.




### Freerunner Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Hunter Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Freerunner Spells

| 3rd | *haste* |
| 5th | *spider climb* |
| 9th | *fast step* |
| 13th | *dimension door* |
| 17th | *passwall* |


### Freerunning
Starting at 3rd level, you have trained extensively to move freely over and through any terrain using only the abilities of the body. You gain proficiency with Acrobatics, and can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) when making a check to climb, jump, or swing on a rope.

Additionally, you have mastered a number of techniques:
- **Slide**. As a ***bonus action***, you can move up to 10 feet without spending movement through another creature’s space or squeeze up to 10 feet through a smaller space.
- **Tumble**. As a ***bonus action***, you can nimbly jump, dive, or roll up to 10 feet in a straight line without spending movement. During this movement, any attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage.
- **Wall Run**. As a ***bonus action***, you can choose to run along a vertical surface as part of your movement. Until the end of your turn, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. If you jump while running along a wall, you can complete the distance of your jump, even if doing so would exceed your movement speed.

### Momentum
At 3rd level, if you move through a hostile creature’s space, leave a creature’s reach, or move at least 15 feet vertically, you deal an additional 1d6 damage on the next weapon attack you make on your turn.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Evasive Fighter
Beginning at 7th level, when you use a freerunning technique, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.

### Hit Hard, Hit Fast
Starting at 11th level, the additional damage from your Momentum feature increases to 2d6.

### Nimble Dodge
At 15th level, when a spell or other effect would have you make a saving throw due to being in an area of effect, you can use your ***reaction*** to move up to half your movement speed, potentially moving you outside the effect’s area.

| 15th | Shadowy Dodge |

</div>

Gloomstalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloomstalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.




### Gloomstalker Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloomstalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Gloomstalker Spells

### Dread Ambusher
At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon’s damage type.



### Low-light Vision
From 3rd level, you can see in dim light within 120 feet as if it were bright light.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Iron Mind
By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Stalker’s Flurry
At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

### Shadowy Dodge
Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn’t have advantage on the roll, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

</div>

Herbalist rangers have learned to extract the magical properties of plants and nature in order to create potent mixtures that can aid allies and hinder foes.




### Herbalist Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Herbalist Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| 5th | *aid* |
| 9th | *create food and water* |
| 13th | *blight* |
| 17th | *greater restoration* |


### Alchemist
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the herbalist kits and you add double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make using it. Additionally, the gold and time you must spend to create antitoxins and potions using an herbalism kit is halved.

### Volatile Mixtures
At 3rd level, as long as you have an herbalism kit, at the end of a long rest, you prepare five mixtures, chosen from the list below, in any combination. For example, you can prepare three healing draughts and two quick coatings at the end of a long rest.

It is assumed that your mixtures are created from ingredients foraged or gathered while traveling. Your mixtures lose their potency after 24 hours. Some mixtures require a target to make a saving throw to resist the mixture's effects. The saving throw DC is your ranger spell save DC.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Healing Draught**. This draught takes an ***action*** to drink or administer to another creature. Creatures that drink this draught regains 1d6 hit points. This draught has no effect on undead or constructs. The healing increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (2d6).

- **Restorative Draught**. This draught takes an ***action*** to drink or administer to another creature. Creatures that drink this draught is cured of either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. This draught has no effect on undead or constructs.

- **Quick Coating**. As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you can coat one melee weapon or up to five pieces of ammunition with a reactive alchemical mixture. Once applied, the coating loses its potency at the start of your next turn. A coated weapon or piece of ammunition deals an additional 1d6 damage. The damage type is acid, cold, fire, or poison (your choice). The additional damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (2d6).

- **Poison Bomb**. As an ***action***, you can throw this flask to a point up to 20 feet from you, shattering it on impact, releasing a small cloud of poison that disperses quickly. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success. Holding one's breath is ineffective against the poison, as it affects the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

- **Smoke Bomb**. As an ***action***, you can throw this flask to a point up to 20 feet from you, shattering it on impact. It creates a 10-foot-radius sphere of smoke centered on the point of impact. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for one minute or until winds (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it.

- **Sludge Bomb**. As an action, you can throw this flask to a point up to 20 feet from you, shattering it on impact. The ground in a 5-foot-radius centered on that point becomes difficult terrain for one minute.

</div>

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.








### Natural Resistance
At 7th level, due to repeated exposure to alchemical mixtures and poisons, your body’s natural resistances have increased. You gain proficiency with Constitution saving throws.

### Quick Mixing
At 11th level, at the end of a long rest, you prepare an additional number of mixtures equal to your Wisdom modifier (total of 5 + your Wisdom modifier).



### Master Alchemist
At 15th level, you have mastered your mixtures’ recipes, and have learned to combine your ingredients to deadly effectiveness. Your mixtures gain additional effects:

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Healing Draught**. You add your Wisdom modifier to the amount of hit points the draught restores.

- **Restorative Draught**. In addition to curing one disease or condition, the mixture also reduces the target's exhaustion level by one.

- **Quick Coating**. When you roll damage for the quick coating, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

- **Poison Bomb**. A creature who succeeds on the saving throw takes half the damage instead of no damage.

- **Smoke Bomb**. The smoke's radius increases to 15 feet, and it lasts for up to 10 minutes. Winds can no longer disperse the smoke.

- **Sludge Bomb**. When a Large or smaller creature enters the sludge’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled by the sludge until the start of its next turn.

Horizon Walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their foes.

These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse — especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals — that work to preserve life and the order of the planes.



### Horizon Walker Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

As a ***bonus action***, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Ethereal Step
At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a ***bonus action***, you can cast the *etherealness* spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Distant Strike
At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.

If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.

### Spectral Defense
At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to give yourself resistance to that attack’s damage on this turn.

You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.



### Monster Slayer Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Monster Slayer Spells

### Hunter’s Sense
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it.

As an ***action***, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

### Slayer’s Prey
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a ***bonus action***, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.



This benefit lasts until you finish a short rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Supernatural Defense
At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body.

Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target’s grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.

### Magic-User’s Nemesis
At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else’s magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your ***reaction*** to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Slayer’s Counter
At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Nightstalker Magic, Shadow Familiar |
| 5th | Extra Attack |
| 7th | Shadowy Transposition |
| 11th | Dark Sentinel |
| 15th | Midnight Bulwark |

</div>

The Nightstalker conclave emulates a unique form of shadow magic, used to create shadowy familiars to accompany you in battle. By walking this path, you learn to use your shadow familiar like an extension of yourself, using them like a weapon as you stalk through the dim forests and vast plains of the world, searching for your prey. Your choice of familiar defines your style of fighting, with each familiar playing a different role on the hunt and on the battlefield.

### Nightstalker Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Nightstalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Nightstalker Spells
| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | *cloak of shadow* |
| 5th | *umbral form* |
| 9th | *doomhound* |
| 13th | *rend shadows* |
| 17th | *Lorlovim's creeping shadow* |


### Shadow Familiar
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to summon a creature of shadow to serve you. As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you can conjure or dismiss your shadow familiar, which takes the form of a spectral creature that cannot be targeted or damaged. You choose the form you can create when you select this subclass.

When you conjure your shadow familiar, it appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. As long as it is conjured, you can forgo one or more of your attacks when you use the Attack action to have your shadow familiar make attacks of its own. The attacks use your spell attack modifier for their attacks, and the familiar makes one melee attack for each attack you forgo. While within 120 ft of your familiar, you can command it to move (no action required). The speeds and attacks of the three forms are listed below.

 **Bear**. This form has a speed of 30 feet. On a hit, its attack deals 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage, and trigger any spells or features that would trigger from your own  attacks (such as Hunter’s Mark).

 **Raven**. This form has a flying speed of 90 feet, and a walking speed of 10 feet. On a hit, its attack deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage, and causes the next attack made against the target before the end of your next turn to be made at advantage.

 **Wolf**. This form has a speed of 40 feet. On a hit, its attack deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage, and causes its target to have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Shadowy Transposition
Starting at 7th level, whenever you cast a ranger spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to swap locations with your familiar immediately before or after casting the spell.

### Dark Sentinel
At 11th level, whenever a creature leaves the reach of your shadow familiar, you can use your ***reaction*** to have it make an attack of opportunity against that creature.

### Midnight Bulwark
Beginning at 15th level, whenever a creature adjacent to your shadow familiar makes an attack against you, you can use your ***reaction*** to have the familiar make an attack against that creature.

Additionally, whenever you command your familiar to make an attack using your reaction and the attack hits, the target’s speed is reduced to half until the end of the target’s current turn.

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Investigator’s Intellect,<br/>Penetrating Insight |
| 5th | Extra Attack |
| 7th | Iron Mind |
| 11th | Informant Network,<br/>Twenty Moves Ahead |
| 15th | Reliable Insight |

</div>

At first glance, you seem hopelessly out of place in an adventuring party, looking instead like a drab town dweller who has wandered into danger by mistake. You maintain a soft-spoken, rather nondescript demeanor, but this is only a facade, concealing keen senses, a shrewd mind, and remarkable insight. Only your closest friends realize the extent of your expertise in intelligence gathering. And that's just the way you like it. Stalkers serve as investigators, spies, informants, interrogators, and vigilantes.

Unlike other rangers, you are just as at home in a crowded metropolis as you are in a wilderness setting. Like all rangers, you are a master of the hunt, but when your prey can be as intelligent, sophisticated, or devious as yourself, hunting them is a far more complex task. You are experienced in solving intricate mysteries and bringing justice to the masterminds behind ambitious crimes. As comfortable stalking your quarry in a bustling city as a savage wilderness, you are no mere urban ranger, but a master of observation, deduction, and interrogation.




### Investigator’s Intellect
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a superior mastery of skills related to obtaining information, allowing you to find clues others might miss. This gives you a number of benefits:
* You gain proficiency with Insight, Investigation, Perception and thieves’ tools.
* After you have attempted an check with one of those skill, you can choose to spend a spell slot to reroll, gaining a bonus on the second roll equal to 1d4 + the level of the spell slot spent.



### Penetrating Insight
Also at 3rd level, you can focus your deductive powers on a single target, analyzing its weaknesses and gaining insights on how to defeat it. As a ***bonus action***, you can force a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated to make a Charisma saving throw against your ranger spell DC. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is your favored enemy. If the creature succeeds, they are immune to this effect for 1 hour.

If the target fails, once during each of your turns, you can roll 1d6 and add the result to one of the following rolls of your choice:
 * A damage roll against the target.
 * A Charisma check to influence the target.
 * An Intelligence or Wisdom check to discern information about the target.

These benefits last until you target a different creature with this feature or until you finish a long rest.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Iron Mind
At 7th level, you have trained your mind to an extraordinary level of insight, memory, and attention to detail and gain the following benefits:
* You add your Intelligence modifier to your Perception and Insight checks.
* You can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past 72 hours.

### Informant Network
At 11th level, you have carefully built up a network of informants who you can contact from almost anywhere (via a messenger bird, magic, or other). These informants are mix of guards, beggars, vagabonds, merchants, and allied government officials who have enough personal loyalty to you to perform routine favors, but not to risk their safety. As long as you are within 100 miles of a settlement that includes at least 100 intelligent creatures with whom you share a language, you can use the following abilities:

* You can cast the *commune* and *legend lore* spells as rituals with a 1 hour casting time. These are not magical effects, being information from your network rather than divinations, and can be used even if magic is unavailable. Any references deities in those spells instead reference your network. You can gain any information that is known by more than 1 person within 200 miles, within the limitations of the spells. The casting time is the time it takes to contact your network and get back your answer.

* You choose a location that you have seen before, or a public location which has been described to you in some detail, and ask members of your network to watch it for one hour. At the end of that hour, you are informed of everything that could've been seen in that location within the last hour, as if you had been watching it yourself with a *scrying* spell.

* You use your existing network’s contacts to get knowledge about an unfamiliar city or town you are nearby. When you within 5 miles of a settlement with a population of at least 100 intelligent creatures, you can spend 1 hour following up on leads from your contacts to gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the settlement:

	- major criminal organizations and cult activities
	- significant underground tunnels or architecture
	- popular religious groups and places of worship
	- powerful figures in government and commerce
	- individuals who inspire great awe or fear (such as archmages or legendary warriors)
	- basic demographics of the population (percentage of humans and other races, etc.)
	- rumors of monsters dwelling in the settlement or nearby (including below it)
	- any large wilderness areas inside or close to the settlement
	- other settlements or cultures nearby

For example, if you entered a new city and used this ability, you could determine its most powerful thieves’ guild, the locations of temples that can provide magical healing, and which graveyards are said to be haunted by undead.



### Twenty Moves Ahead
Also at 11th level, you can see through your opponent's deceptions and anticipate their actions. When a creature that is the target of your Penetrating Insight feature misses you with an attack roll, that creature provokes an opportunity attack from you. In addition, all checks to deceive you are made with disadvantage.

### Reliable Insight
Beginning at 15th level, while a creature that you have successfully used your Penetrating Insight feature on within the last hour is also the target of a spell on which you are maintaining concentration, you have advantage on attack rolls and Insight checks against that creature.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-banshee">Restricted to Awakened (bound spirit) characters</a></h2>
<h1>Banshee Conclave</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
|:--:|:--|
| 3rd | Dreadful Visage, Phaseblade
| 5th | Terrorizer
| 7th | Creature of Fear
| 11th | Haunting Keen
| 15th | Lament

</div>

Gifted with power from the dark corners of the feywild, this conclave embodies the horror that haunts the hills. Banshees imitate spirits and spectres to stalk, terrify, and slaughter their enemies. They are the very image of fear, whose knives gleam grisly silver and whose terrible howls chill the soul.

##### Restriction
The Banshee conclave can only be taken by an awakened **bound spirit**.

### Bonus Spells
You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Banshee Magic table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.


#### Banshee Magic
| Ranger Level | Spells |
| :----------: | :----- |
| 3rd | _catapult_
| 5th | _shadow blade_
| 9th | _fear_
| 13th | _crystal wail_
| 17th | _telekinesis_


### Dreadful Visage
You specialize in hunting the cowardly. You can use a ***bonus action*** to transform your face into a terrible countenance for a split second. Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you. The sight of you forces that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, it is frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the your Dreadful Visage for the next 24 hours. A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against this feature if one or more creatures within 30 of it are also frightened of you.



### Phaseblade
Your ghostly nature transforms your weapons. Once per turn when you make a weapon attack, you can phase your weapon or ammunition through the target. This attack deals your choice of cold, necrotic, or psychic damage, and deals an extra 1d8 damage of the chosen type. If the target is frightened, the attack roll ignores AC bonuses granted by shields, parrying reactions, and all but total cover.

### Terrorizer
You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are frightened of you.

### Creature of Fear
You have become so used to using fear as a weapon that the same tactic doesn't work against you. You are immune to the frightened condition, and gain proficiency with Charisma saving throws.

### Haunting Keen
You can use Dreadful Visage when you roll initiative. Whenever you use Dreadful Visage in this way, you can replace the facial transformation with a horrific wail that affects all hostile creatures within 60 feet of you, instead of one creature.

### Lament
You can use your ***reaction*** to let out a mournful wail that wards off death when one friendly creature that you can see within 60 feet drops to 0 hit points. Until that creature is stabilized, it has advantage on death saving throws and attack rolls made against it have disadvantage. You can use this ***reaction*** immediately before being knocked to 0 hit points to gain its benefits yourself.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and must complete a long rest before you do so again.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-trickster">Restricted to Gnome & Kobold characters</a></h2>
<h1>Trickster Conclave</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Conclave Features
| Ranger Level | Feature |
| :----------: | :------ |
| 3rd | Combat Trickster, Opportune Strike |
| 5th | Rabbit from a Hat |
| 7th | Out of Sight, Out of Reach, Combat Trickster (additional tricks, d8 damage) |
| 11th | Exploitative Nature |
| 15th | Elusive Foe, Combat Trickster (additional tricks) |

</div>

Kobold and Gnome rangers are regularly underestimated, but those in the Trickster conclave use that lack of esteem as both a defense and an offense, when need be. Using their cleverness and various talents, they create their own advantages in order to level the playing field.

##### Restriction
The Trickster conclave can only be taken by a Gnome or Kobold character.

### Combat Trickster
Starting when you join this conclave, you learn how to use your ingenuity, deft hands, and the knowledge you've accumulated, to counteract that you are physically at a disadvantage to most foes. You gain proficiency with tinker’s tools if you don't have it already.

 **Combat Tricks**. The conclave has entrusted you with three blueprints and designs for combat tricks; items meant to hinder your enemies. The combat tricks are detailed at the end of the archetype description. You learn the design of one additional combat trick at 7th and 15th level.

 **Trick Capacity**. Using your tinker tools, you can spend a short rest crafting or repairing a combat trick. You can only carry four of these combat tricks at any given time. Your trick capacity increases by one at 7th level and 15th level.

 **Saving Throws**. Your combat tricks require creatures that trigger them to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Combat Trick DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice)

### Opportune Strike
You have leart how to exploit the openings your combat tricks create. When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can use a ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack against it. Additionally, you never trigger your own combat tricks unless you want to.

### Rabbit From a Hat
Your familiarity with the combat tricks you employ improves your handling of them. You can choose to use combat tricks as a ***bonus action***.

Additionally, when you craft or repair a combat trick, you can spend a spell slot to enchant it. An item enchanted in this way deals your choice of fire or poison damage when a creature fails its saving throw against it. The damage is 3d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st. If more than one combat trick is placed in the same area, a creature only takes damage from the most powerful of them. Regardless of whether the creature fails its saving throw or not, the magic imbued in the item is expended.

### Out of Sight, Out of Reach
You always have a plan to get out of a sticky situation. You can use a ***bonus action*** to take the Disengage action.

### Exploitative Nature
Your keen eye knows exactly which signs to look for, and how to exploit a show of weakness, no matter how slight it is. When you use a ***reaction*** to attack a creature because it failed a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can make two weapon attacks instead of one.

### Elusive Foe
You can use every opportunity to get out of dodge. When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your combat tricks, you can use your ***reaction*** to move up to half your speed.

### Combat tricks
Some of the items here are also in the Player's Handbook, but these versions are slightly improved, due to the time, effort, and talent poured into making them.

In addition to hindering your enemies in some way, some are also designed to harm. When combat tricks deal damage, they refer to your trick die, which starts out as d6, and at 7th level it becomes d8.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Ball bearings (bag of 1,000)**. As an ***action***, you can spill these tiny metal, glass, crystal, stone, or bone balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. The first Large or smaller creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, taking 1 trick die of bludgeoning damage.

- **Caltrops (bag of 20)**. As an ***action***, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. The first creature that enters the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 2 trick dice of piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed makes the saving throw with advantage.

- **Flash Rods (one pair)**. As an ***action***, you can place these two rods connected by a thin wire on a flat surface. The first creature that passes between the rods trips the wire, making the rods flare up in an intensely bright light. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the turn.

- **Oil Fountain**. As an ***action***, you can place this small metal cube attached to a pressure plate on the ground. The first creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be sprayed with a highly volatile substance. If the creature takes fire or lightning damage before the substance evaporates at the start of its next turn, it takes 1 trick die fire damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to withstand the shock of being lit on fire. If it fails, it must use its reaction to move its movement speed in a random direction.

    -- **Special**. An oil trap is harder to place  efficiently, so it can only be placed as an action, even with the Rabbit from a hat feature.

-**Portable Ice (bag of 50)**. As an ***action***, you can spread a single bag of these compressed ice pellets to cover a 5-foot-square area. The first creature that enters the area triggers the pellets, making them expand rapidly, forming a 20-feet tall ice pillar that immediately shatters. Any Large or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. Tiny creatures don't trigger the pellets.

    -- **Special**. You need access to water to craft these pellets, and they melt after 1 hour if in extreme heat.

- **Screeching Sirens (soundproof container)**. As an ***action***, you can place the brittle container on the ground. The first Small or larger creature that enters its 5-foot area causes the container to break, releasing the short-lived bugs inside it. The bugs are drawn to the nearest source of body heat, while emitting a high-pitched sound. Until the start of its next turn, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw in order to cast a spell with verbal components.

    --**Special**. You need access to bugs normally found in the wild to collect enough of them to be efficient, so the DM may rule that a city, dungeon or similar restricts how many, if any, you can craft.

- **Snap trap**. When you use your ***action*** to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1 trick die of piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 trick die of piercing damage to the trapped creature.

    -- **Special**. A snap trap is harder to place efficiently, so it can only be placed as an action, even with the Rabbit from a hat feature.

- **Sonic Sphere**. As an ***action***, you can place a small metal sphere on the ground. Highly sensitive to vibrations in the ground, the sphere will activate when the first creature enters its 5-foot area, creating a burst of thunderous sound, which can be heard 100 feet away. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2 trick dice thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.

- **Sneezing Powder Pellets (bag of 10)**. As an ***action***, you spread a single bag of these hollow, lightweight husks filled with ground seeds to cover a 5-foot square. The first creature that enters the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 trick die of poison damage and spend its action sneezing violently.

- **Twitchers (bag of 40)**. As an ***action***, you use a single bag of these tiny metal rods holding trace amounts of lightning energy to cover two 5-foot-square areas. The first creature that enters an area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 trick die of lightning damage from the small current running through them. A creature that fails this saving throw has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn.
