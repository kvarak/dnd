# Druid
Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.

Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.

</div>

As a druid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8

#### Saving Throws
You are proficient with ***Intelligence*** and ***Wisdom*** saving throws.

#### Skills
**Class Skills:** Agriculture, Animal handling, Herbalism, Nature, Survival and Swimming

**Skill Points:** You gain 3 skill points at 1st level.

#### Skills - Combat
**Weapon Groups:** You have rank 1 with Club, Knife, Spear, Staff and Sling.

**Combat Skills:** You gain the *Light armor* and *Medium armor* skills.

**Special:** Druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal.

**After 1st level:** You gain 1 skill point to spend on combat skills every even level.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a wooden shield or *(b)* any simple weapon
- Any simple melee weapon
- Leather armor (if proficient), an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

##### Sacred Plats and Knowledge
A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.

Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown
weapons, such as darts or javelins.

Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

</div>

### Communicate with Nature
Select one of the following:

***Druidic***: You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language at the highest level and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

***Raised by Beasts***: Choose one beast that you have seen before. You can comprehend and verbally communicate with others of its kind. Your DM may decide that your ability to speak with the species of beast allows you to speak with a similar species of beast. For example, if you can speak with brown bears, your DM may decide that you can also speak with polar bears.

### Druid Circle
When becoming a druid, you choose to identify with a circle, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned with another cantrip from your spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain your 2 lowest expended spell slots after a night's rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells up to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish every morning. However, if you do not have your maximum number of spells prepared, you can add a new spell to your list of prepared spells at any time. Both these activities requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each new spell.


#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

* **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
* **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

<div class="card rest">
<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Long rest |
|:-|
| Add the following class specific benefits to choose from: |
| * Regain all uses of ***Wild Shape***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Borrowing
You gain the ability to borrow the mind of animals: as an ***action***, you can choose a number of willing beasts up to 3 x times your druid level and expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the *beast sense* spell on them all.

When you cast the spell in this way, the spell doesn't require material components nor concentration, and lasts a number of hours equal to half your druid level. The material body you leave behind is unconscious until you end the spell by using your action to return to your normal senses.

You can only use one of the animals' senses at a time, but you can switch at will.

### Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your ***action*** to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. See the *Class Rest Additions* for more details.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.


#### Beast Shapes

| Level | Max CR | Limitations | Example |
|:-----:|:------:|:------------|:--------|
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | — | Giant eagle |


You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a ***bonus action*** on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

<div class="cursedcols">

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain your skills, saving throw proficiencies and the languages you know, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

* When you transform, you assume the beast's average hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and lose one unspent hit die or suffer a level of exhaustion if you have no hit dice remaining.

* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you cannot use multiattack in your new form until you are a 5th-level druid (or higher).

* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

</div>

### Wild Companion
You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an ***action***, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the *Find familiar* spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

<!--
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
-->

### Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Beast Spells
Beginning at 16th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

### Archdruid
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-druid-circles">Druid Circles</a>

Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **<a href="#internal-blood">Circle of Blood</a>** Druids that can wildshape parts of their body, even to several animals at once.

- **<a href="#internal-dreams">Circle of Dreams</a>** Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-blood">Circle of Blood</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Circle of Blood Features
| Druid Level | Feature |
|:-----------:|:--------|
| 2nd | Aspects of the beast |
| 6th | Extra Attack |
| 10th | Supernatural Aspect |
| 14th | Primal Magic |

</div>

The Circle of Blood is composed of druids who take a more active role in the safeguarding nature against fel beasts and aberrations that seek not only to exploit the wilds, but render them completely violate. Druids of the circle of Blood often find themselves allying with rivals and former enemies and so grow accustomed to living in civilized lands.

In an effort to strike a balance between ferocity and utility, druids of this circle focus on adopting partial forms of beasts while retaining they're humanoid base. The result is a warrior fights with steel and shield, but who can manifest wings, claws, fangs, and toughened skin as challenges present themselves. True masters of this circle have even developed the ability to adopt features of truly supernatural beasts, such as dragons, unicorns, or trolls. Often known as Wardens or Geomancers, these warriors walk the line between man and monster, and use their prowess for the greater good.

### Aspects of the beast
You learn how to shape your body to improve your base abilities without sacrificing your humanoid form. When you use your Wild shape ability, you may choose to gain up to two beast aspects instead of assuming a beast shape. Different aspects change different parts of the body, and you can only have one aspect per body part at simultaneously at any time. Using Wild shape this way only requires a ***bonus action***.

You can still fight, speak, and casts spells while you have a beast aspect. If you gain a new attack as part of a beast aspect, you are considered proficient with it.

At higher levels, you can adopt both more aspects simultaneously and more powerful aspects. At 6th level, you can have three beast aspects at a time. At 10th level, you can have four. And at 14th level, you can have up to 5 beast aspects.

    **Snake's Fang**. You can use a ***bonus action*** to make a bite attack. On a hit, you deal 1d8 + Strength modifier piercing damage, and the target must make a Constitution save or become poisoned until the end of your next turn. The DC is equal to your spell save DC.

Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.

### Balm of the Summer Court
You become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a ***bonus action***, you can target a creature within 120 ft and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You can regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow
Home can be wherever you are. During a rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30 ft radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus on all check to avoid detection and notice danger, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

### Hidden Paths
You can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 ft to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your ***action*** to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see.

### Walker in Dreams
The magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

You can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: *dream* (with you as the messenger), *scrying*, or *teleportation circle*.

When you cast *teleportation circle* from this feature or from casting it with a druid spell slot, rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.

Once you use this feature, you may regain its use after you finish a long rest.

The Circle of Dust is an order of druids seen as something of an aberration by more traditional druids of the Circles of Land and the Moon. Some are sad, wandering prophets offering succor through sometimes frightening powers coaxed from a ravaged world. The worst of the lot are misbegotten, insane harbingers of apocalypse that preach doom and bring further ruin.

### Theft of Life
Even if you do not choose to cast healing magic, your unique abilities allow you to "steal" life energy provided by such spells and use it for your own purposes.

You may use your ***reaction*** when a spell or other magical power that restores lost hit points is used within 60 ft. You may immediately expend a single hit die and roll it to recover from damage as though you had used it during a short rest. This roll is made with advantage.

### Entropic Exchange
You gain the ability to siphon life force from healthy allies in order to mend the wounds of others. During a short rest, two willing creatures can participate in the process, and you may act as the source if you so desire.

The source of the healing may donate hit dice up to a maximum of your class level. The dice are then rolled as though being used to recuperate during a short rest, and the total is given to the target of the exchange.

A source that does not possess spendable hit dice (such as a monstrous ally) or one who no longer has hit dice to spend may instead elect to suffer 1d10 points of necrotic damage for each hit die they would have otherwise expended, with the damage total being used to fuel the healing on the target.

### Ash and Wind
You can expend a use of your Wild shape ability to transform into a cloud of dust and cooled embers. The ash and wind form fonctions as the *gaseous form* spell, with the following exceptions:

- You cannot make physical attacks, cast spells or speak, but you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks. You do not lose concentration on spells already cast. Upon reaching 18th level, you can cast spells while in this form (as per the beast spells druid ability).
- When you transform, you assume a hit point total equal to your Wisdom modifier times your level. If these hit points are lost before you return to your druid form, you drop out of the ash and wind form just as you would with a normal use of wild shape to become an animal.
- You can fly at a speed of 40 ft.
- You have advantage on checks to avoid notice, as you make very little to no noise.

### Resist Decay
Walking the line between survival and ruin grants a Circle of Dust druid significant resilience against effects that ravage the body. You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and resistance to necrotic damage.

### Wrack or Repeal
Suffering and destruction are such a part of the Circle of Dust that its most powerful druids can manipulate the echoes of harmful events. You can wrack or repeal as a ***reaction*** any time you or an ally within 60 ft suffers from any event that causes hit point damage. The damage suffered is immediately halved and you can decide what to do with the remaining half, electing to either wrack or repeal.

If you elect to wrack, half of the damage is immediately reflected back upon the attacker. This damage is of the same type as the triggering attack.

If you elect to repeal, half of the damage is converted to healing and can be distributed to any number of allies within 60 ft of you, as long as they are not the same individual whose damage was reduced.

You may use wrack or repeal once upon reaching 14th level, gaining an additional use at 18th level.

#### Circle Features
| Druid Level | Feature |

| 2nd | Plant Shape,<br>One with the Forest |
| 6th | Plant Shape (improved),<br>Power of the Forest |
| 10th | Power of the Forest |
| 14th | Crushing Grasp |

</div>

While most druids have a kinship with the woods and forests, druids who belong to the Circle of the Forest have such an affinity that many wonder where the forest ends and the druid starts. They delve deeper into the ancient rituals and hidden knowledge of plant magic, which helps them to safeguard sacred groves and forests to preserve the natural balance of plants. They serve as the first line of defense against any force that seeks to desecrate these lands, animating the forest itself to fight against their foes.

These druids feel most comfortable deep in the green wilderness, and place great value in its unspoiled form, sharing a world view more in common with dryads and treants than other mortals. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Circle of the Forest Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

#### Circle of the Forest Quirks
| d6 | Quirk |
|:---:|:--------|
| 1 | You have a strong dislike of fire, and put them out wherever possible.
| 2 | You have an irrational fear of saws and axes.
| 3|  You find other mortals to always be in a terrible hurry.
| 4 | You can taste 14 flavors of sunlight. Most of them are delicious.
| 5 | Your hair is a deep, forest green. On a bad hair day, you can't get the leaves out of your hair.
| 6 | You tend to simply say your own name as means of communication.

### Plant Shape
When you gain the ability to use Wild Shape at 2nd level, you learn how to assume the shape of a plant creature. When you transform into a plant creature, the max CR that you can transform into is increased to 1. Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a plant with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

When transformed into a plant creature, you gain the ability to command nearby mundane plants. As an ***action***, you can turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth into ordinary terrain in a 5 ft radius centered on you, or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain in a 5 ft radius centered on you. After a 10 minute duration, the plants return to their original condition.

### One with the Forest
You gain more kinship with plants. Select one of the following features

#### Forest Form
You gain the ability to activate the deep magic of old forests that infuses your body. As a ***bonus action***, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature or a 3rd level spell slot or higher to assume a treelike form; your becomes skin tough and hardy like the eldest trees of the forest, you sprout moss and vines, and leaves and flowers unfurl in your hair.

While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

  * If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn’t change.

  * When you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your armor class is equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

  * You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws.

  * Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 + Wisdom bludgeoning damage on hit. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can use a ***bonus action*** to attempt to grapple the target.

</div>

#### Plant Summoner
You can cause a Medium or smaller plant within 30 ft to come to life. As an ***action***, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature or a 3rd level spell slot or higher to awaken the plant.

The plant is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Use the statistics of your choice from the Blight or Fungal stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the plant shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a ***bonus action*** to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the plant can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The plant manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to awaken another plant, or until you die.

### Power of the Forest
Select one of the following features:

#### Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities.

#### Take Root
You gain the ability to root yourself in the ground while in your normal form, forming a protective armor of bark around yourself. As an ***action***, you can root yourself in the ground, reducing your speed to 0 and granting you advantage on checks made to avoid being moved.

Until you end this effect using your ***bonus action*** or fall unconscious, you have a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to all damage except psychic and fire.

### Power of the Forest
Select one of the following features:

#### Greater Awakened Plant
Your Plant Summoner abilities improves in the following ways:
 * You can increase the size of an awakened plant to Large

 * At the start of each of its turns, your Awakened Plant regains a number of hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

 * The Awakened Plant adds one additional damage die to its damage rolls.

 * ***(Blight Only)*** Upon hitting a creature with its vine attack, the target must succeed a Strength saving throw equal to your spell save DC or become grappled. On a failed saving throw, it can use its action to break free

 * ***(Fungal Only)*** Creatures hit by the awakened plant's attacks must succeed a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

#### Old Growth
You have become hard and sturdy like the eldest trees of the forest. When you activate your Forest Form feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your druid level + your Wisdom modifier. While in this shape, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration of your transformation.

### Crushing Grasp
Your intimate connection to the ancient forests of the world allows you to stimulate wild plant growth at will. You in your Forest Form or one of your awakened plants grow a number of grasping roots and branches equal to your Wisdom modifier. These roots and branches function as rudimentary limbs that can grapple enemies.

Any creature grappled or restrained by you or an awakened plant (by a grapple or a spell such as entangle) takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier at the start of their turn as your grasp crushes them.

The Circle of the Garden is one of peace, nurturing, and a deep respect for plant life. These druids learn to grow the tallest trees, the sweetest flowers, and the most potent herbs. It's through this love of flora that they channel their powers, able to coax their green allies into forms to help and hinder. Bringing their gardens with them, a druid of this circle is always on the lookout for new additions and amazing herbal discoveries.

### Green Thumb
Starting when you join this circle at 1st level, you gain 1 skill point each to spend on ***Agriculture*** and ***Herbalism***.

### Grow the Garden
You can bring forth new life into the world. As an ***action***, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to spread lush vegetation from a point on the ground you can see within 30 ft. The radius of the vegetation is a number of feet equal to or less than 5 × your Druid level and it withers after a number of hours equal to half your Druid level, or when you use this feature again.

When you use this feature, you can select a unique botanical property to instill within the vegetation. If you do so, the vegetation withers after 1 minute. Choose one of the following options:

 **Invigorating Pollen**. As a ***bonus action*** on each of your turns, you can choose one friendly creature on the ground within the vegetation. That creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

 **Snare Root**. As a ***reaction***, when a creature enters the vegetation or attempts to leave its radius, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to 10 ft towards the center of the vegetation and restrained until the start of its next turn. A creature can use its action to attempt to free itself or a restrained creature by making a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself or a restrained creature.

 **Viper Vines**. When you spread your vegetation, and as an ***action*** on each of your turns, you can have poisonous vines rear up and lash out. Each hostile creature of your choice on the ground within the vegetation must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take an amount of poison damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier.

### Shape Flora
As an ***action*** you can touch a Huge or smaller living plant and encourage it to grow. The plant doubles in size over the course of 10 minutes, and you can reshape it into a simple form of your choice, such as a makeshift shelter, or a bridge. You can only double the size of any plant once with this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and can regain all uses when you complete a long rest.

### Verdant Expanse
You gain the following additional benefits when you instill the vegetation created by your Grow the Garden feature.

 **Invigorating Pollen**. If the creature you choose is below half its hit point maximum, it regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

 **Snare Root**. The creature is pulled up to 30 ft instead of 10, and it is restrained until the end of its next turn.

 **Viper Vines**. The poison damage you deal increases by 2d6, and creatures take half of the damage on a successful save.

### Green Guardian
You can call upon the ire of nature in times of peril. As an ***action*** you can summon a hulking plant protector using the statistics of a shambling mound, that fades after 1 minute, or once it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The protector appears in an unoccupied space within 10 ft. Roll initiative for the protector. On its turn, it attempts to protect you from any creatures that would seek to harm you as best it can.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.

### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to additional spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and select two of the spells listed as circle spells from a spell level that you can cast. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

### Natural Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature for 10 minutes. You recover expended spell slots that can have a combined level equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

### Land's Stride
Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

### Nature's Ward
You can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

### Nature's Sanctuary
Creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

</div>

Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.

### Bonus Skills
You gain 1 skill point to spend on combat skills.

### Circle Forms
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. You can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

### Combat Wild Shape
You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a ***bonus action***, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a ***bonus action*** to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

### Primal Strike
Your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Elemental Wild Shape
You can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.

### Thousand Forms

</div>

Druids of the Circle of the Sands finds the toughest life in one of the harshest place of the world — the deserts. Fascinated at how life finds a way to survive and thrive in the barren lands, the druid contemplates the tenacity of life, bathing in the scorching sun and roaring sandstorms. Like the shifting sands and winds of the desert, most druids of Circle of Sands prefer nomadic lifestyle over settling into a fixed location. However, some druids of Circle of the Sands stay within a settlement as caretakers and protectors.

### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the desert grants you ability to cast certain spells. When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn the *air mastery* cantrip in addition to your other cantrips.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to additional spells. Select two of the spells listed as circle spells from a spell level that you can cast. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

### Shifting Sands
When you cast a druid spell of 1st level and higher that requires concentration, you can conjure a gust of wind that surrounds you for 1 minute or until your concentration on the spell is broken.

The gust of winds creates a small vortex centered on you, out to a radius of 5 feet. When a hostile creature first enters the area within the vortex or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your druid spell save DC or be knocked prone.

Additionally, all ranged attacks against you have disadvantage.

You can expend one use of your Wild Shape as a ***bonus action*** to use this feature without casting a druid spell. If you use this feature this way, the wind lasts for 1 minute or until concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

### Sprinting Sands
When you use an ***action*** to cast a druid spell of 1st level and higher, you can use a ***bonus action*** to take the Dash or Disengage action.

Additionally, while you are surrounded by the wind from your Shifting Sands, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement, and you ignore obstacles and hazards on the ground, such as caltrops and the grease spell.

### Howling Sands
When a creature fails on a saving throw against your Shifting Sands, you can apply one of the following options:
- The creature takes slashing damage equal to half your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.
- The creature is blinded and deafened while in the vortex.
- The creature's speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

### Raging Sands
Your Shifting Sands no longer requires concentration, and you can use your Shifting Sands when you cast any druid spell of 1st level and higher.

Additionally, while you are surrounded by the wind from your Shifting Sands, you gain flying speed equal to your walking speed.

</div>

Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.

Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

### Speech of the Woods
At 1st level when you choose this circle, you learn to speak Sylvan and gain the ability to communicate with beasts.

Beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

### Spirit Totem
You can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a ***bonus action***, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 ft. The spirit creates an aura in a 30 ft radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a ***bonus action***, you can move the spirit up to 60 ft to a point you can see. The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.

The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

 **Bear Spirit**. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

 **Hawk Spirit**. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your ***reaction*** to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

 **Unicorn Spirit**. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot, that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.

### Mighty Summoner
Beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:
- The creature appears with 2 extra hit points per Hit Die.
- The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Guardian Spirit
Your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.

### Faithful Summons
The nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless.

If reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of *conjure animals* as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 ft of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes.

The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

</div>

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the  ability to transform lifeless material into  abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are portions of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death is not the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. However, these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

### Circle Spells
Your symbiotic link to fungus and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn the *chill touch* cantrip in addition to your other cantrips.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to additional spells. Select two of the spells listed as circle spells from a spell level that you can cast. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

### Halo of Spores
You can launch spores against other creature, with two different effects.

 **Toxic spores**. You can use your ***reaction*** when you cast a spell of 1st level to deal 5 poison damage to a number of creatures equal to the level of the spell cast that you caee within 10 ft. This damage increases to 8 at 6th level, 10 at 10th level, and 12 at 14th.

 **Decomposing spores**. You can reap energy from death to restore life. When a Small or larger creature within 10 ft of you is killed, you can use your ***reaction*** to gain temporary hit points equal to half your druid level. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

### Symbiotic Entity
You gain the ability to channel magic into the spores that infuse you. When you use your Wild Shape feature, you can awaken those spores, rather than transforming. When you do so, you gain 3 temporary hit points per druid level, the healing and damage from your Halo of Spores feature doubles, and your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to any target they hit.

The poison damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 14th level. These benefits last for 10 minutes or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### Fungal Infestation
Your spores gain the ability to infest a humanoid corpse and animate it. If a humanoid that has received your Halo of Spores damage within the past minute dies, the creature rises as a zombie at the end of your turn, with 1 hit point.

In combat, its turn is immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies. You can have a maximum number of zombies under your control with this feature equal to your Wisdom modifier.

### Spore Mastery
You attain mastery over your spore-infested body. The range of your Halo of Spores feature increases to 20 ft. In addition, when you cast a spell that affects you, you automatically succeed on your saving throw against the spell and take no damage if you would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Fungal Body
The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can’t be blinded, deafened, diseased, or poisoned, and if an attack is a critical hit against you, it does not deal extra damage.

When you die, if your entire body is placed upon or buried in an area of natural growth, your fungal body plants itself in the soil and begins growing a new body. An area with a radius of 5 feet withers and dies as you absorb the life energy of the foliage. Your previous corpse decomposes into the soil. This feature does not work if you are missing any significant part of your body, such as a limb or your head. The parts need not be attached, but must be present.

Over the course of 1 day, your mind incubates a new body out of the biomass from the rotting vegetation and your cadaver. The grown body is identical to your previous one. You recall all your memories and life experiences and retain any capabilities you had at the time of your death. You take a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you finish a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. If you die while you have this penalty, you cannot use this feature.

If the process is disturbed or interrupted, such as by excavation or a spell that dispels magic effects, you do not resurrect and you die permanently, as your body is fully decayed.

</div>

Druids of the Circle of Storms do not form a bond with the earth or its beasts, but with the fury of nature: the raging thunderstorm, the writhing cyclone, and the hammering blizzard. Members of this circle seldom remain in one place, instead roaming like a cloud in the breeze. The sacred sites of these druids are not glades encircled by stones but places where the heavens strike the land, such as storm-wracked beaches and lightning-smote peaks. As a member of this circle, you are keenly aware of the unpredictability and heartlessness of the weather. You might embody this fickle and chaotic rage or act to temper the cruelty of the weather.

### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the sky infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn the *lightning surge* or *thunderclap* cantrip in addition to your other cantrips.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to additional spells. Select two of the spells listed as circle spells from a spell level that you can cast. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

### Cushion of Air
You can cast the *feather fall* spell on yourself only without needing to expend any spell slots or material components. You must finish a short rest before you can use this feature again.

### Thundering Bolts
You pair streaks of lightning with booms of thunder. Whenever you use a cantrip the deals either thunder damage or lightning damage, you deal additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier of the other damage type, such as thunder damage after casting shocking grasp.

### Stormbound
Your connection to storms grants you resistance to thunder and lightning damage. In addition you can cast the *levitate* spell on yourself at will, without expending any spell slots or material components.

### Shape of the Storm
You can expend two uses of Wild Shape to become a storm elemental.

Druids of the Circle of the Swarm have found strength in numbers above all else. They tend to see the world as a collective, and will often often choose the wellbeing of the majority over that of the individual. While not inherently evil, followers of the Swarm may come off as alien or cruel, unable to or unwilling to understand individual concern and feelings, especially those that run contrary to the will of the group.

Druids of the Swarm often develop strange tendencies. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Quirks table.


| d6 | Quirk |
|:--:|:------|
| 1 |	Your skin is deathly pale, and a faint stench of rot hangs around you.
| 2 |	You have a ferocious appetite, often preferring to eat raw meat or bone.
| 3 |	You are prone to clicking your tongue as you speak, or hissing in an animalistic manner.
| 4 |	You laugh as you suffer injuries.
| 5 |	You always refer to yourself as ‘we’.
| 6 | A small colony of insects, spiders or vermin lives in your hair or on your body.

### Speech of the Many
When you choose this circle at 1st level, you gain the ability to converse with insects and similar creatures.

Insects can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. However, most insects lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts. This ability doesn’t grant you any special friendship with insects, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

### Swarm Shape
You have learned how to split your one consciousness into many. You gain the ability to Wild Shape into swarms of beasts, such as the swarm of rats found in the Monster Manual. You must still abide by the limitations of the Beasts Shapes table.

The hit point maximum of your swarm form is increased by your total druid level. This bonus increases to two times your druid level at 6th level, and further increases to three times your druid level at 14th level.

Note that as a swarm, you cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. Unless otherwise specified, all forms of healing are ineffective on you while transformed.

When you revert from or change the creature comprising your swarm form, any parts of the swarm not with the center mass are destroyed.

### Greater Swarm
You have discovered how to share your consciousness with and even greater number of creatures. Any swarm you transform into is now large if it wasn't already bigger. This increases to huge at 12th level.

While in Swarm Form you can make separate attacks against each creature in your space of your choice, or you can make two attacks against one creature in your reach.

### Primal Strike
Your attacks in swarm form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Consuming Swarm
Your swarm can restore itself by feasting on fallen foes. You can use an ***action*** to engulf an adjacent creature that was reduced to 0 hit points since the end of your last turn, and heal yourself 2d8 hit points.

This feature’s healing increases to 3d8 when you reach 14th level, and 4d8 when you reach 17th level.

### Form of the Many
You are never without your swarm and can call upon it at a moments notice. When you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you may as a ***reaction*** gain resistance to the damage using the fluid nature of the swarm within.

Additionally, as part of the same reaction you can expend a use of Wild Shape and transform into a swarm. Any damage from the trigger is dealt to your swarm form instead.

You can use this feature once. See *Rest Additions* below.

### Plague Swarm
You have learned how to call upon the power of a plague to consume your foes. The spell *insect plague* is always prepared, and does not count against the number of spells you can cast each day. In addition, when you cast *insect plague* it gains the following:
- As a ***bonus action*** you can move the sphere up to 40 ft.
- Only creatures of your choice have to make a save.
- For each spell level above 5th, radius increases by 5ft.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-ancients">Restricted to Lizardfolk characters</a></h2>
<h1>Circle of the Ancients</h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Circle Features
| Druid Level | Feature |
|:-----------:|:--------|
| 1st | Summon Nature's Ally
| 2nd | Ancient Forms
| 6th | Primal Strikes
| 10th | Dreadful Wild Shape
| 14th | Monstrous Form

</div>

Most lizardfolk do not worship gods or their ancestors, as they don't see the practical advantage of such a tradition. However, some tribes do possess druidic spellcasters who carry within their blood, whether by heritage or ceremony, the memories of the ancient "terrible lizards", the dinosaurs. Through their druidic powers they draw upon the memories of their ancestors to summon and transform into prehistoric beasts.

##### Restriction
Only lizardfolk follow this path.

### Summon Nature's Ally
As an ***action***, you can use a spell slot to conjure a dinosaur with a CR equal to the level of the spell slot used minus 1 (minimum of 1/2) or lower. It appears in an unoccupied space within 60 ft.

The dinosaur shares your initiative count, and takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a ***bonus action*** on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, Help or Hide action. You don't require any actions to move your Nature's Ally on its own turn. If one of its special traits would require a bonus action, it can use its own.

You must maintain concentration on this, as if you were concentrating on a spell. You can use this feature while in your wild shape form if you have shifted into a dinosaur. Your summoned ally remains until you lose concentration, summon a new ally this way, its hit points are reduced to 0, or until you start a long rest.

### Ancient Forms
As a member of the Circle of the Ancients you carry the memories of the ancient terrible lizards. You can use a ***bonus action***, and expend a use of your Wild Shape to take the form of any reptilian beast or Dinosaur with a CR as high as 1. You ignore the max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by all other limitations.

Dinosaur forms can be found on page 79 of the Monster Manual and on page 139 of Volo's Guide to Monsters. You do not need to have seen the Dinosaurs before in order to Wild Shape into them, as their memory flows in your veins.

However, the ability to Wild Shape into these powerful forms is not without cost. Your ability to Wild Shape ability is now restricted to Dinosaurs and their descendants; birds and reptiles. Examples of avian and reptilian beasts from the Monster Manual include Crocodiles, Snakes and Vultures.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a Dinosaur with a challenge rating as high as your Druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

### Primal Strikes
Your natural weapons and those of your Nature's Ally count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Dreadful Wild Shape
You can expend two uses of your Wild Shape at once to transform into a Dinosaur with a CR equal to your Druid level divided by 2, rounded down.

In addition you have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on your Nature's Ally.

### Monstrous Form
You have mastered the use of your Ancient Forms. You can cast the enlarge portion of *enlarge/reduce* while in Wild Shape as a ***bonus action***, targeting only yourself, without consuming a spell slot.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
