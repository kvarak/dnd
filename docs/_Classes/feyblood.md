# Fey and the Feyblood Class
Fey are intensely magical creatures, closely tied to the forces of wild nature, creatures of raw emotion and unbridled impulse, and creatures that look almost human but with a curious turn of mind that makes them wholly alien at the same time.

Fey are creatures not fully of this world, or perhaps more precisely they are creatures of another version of this world so idealized and yet just off that reality itself could not bear it, utterly beautiful and yet nearly unendurable in its intensity. When fey leave the Feywild and enter our world, the world of mortals, they bring some of that magic and that strangeness with them.

Fey enjoy observing mortals in their natural habitat, so to speak, and may learn many things about them with long exposure to mortal culture and customs, but only rarely are they able to integrate themselves entirely. Even experienced fey wanderers are no more natural a part of the mortals’ culture than a modern family camping in a national park is at one with the animals.

They come from another plane of existence, they’re immortal, and their concerns and way of approaching the world around them may seem bizarre. Noble fey can be aloof, even cold and distant in how they relate to other creatures, and while possessed of a deep capacity for both capricious whimsy and passionate hatred, the triggers for these emotions aren’t always readily obvious.

In truth, fey most often enter the Material Plane out of curiosity or compulsion. They might be called there by a powerful spellcaster, or by deep magic, their returning like a comet on a calendar longer than living memory. These excursions produce bonds of family, love and enmity, echoing down generations. Some fey live a life of adventure in the Material Plane for years, eventually return to the Feywild as if called home, and many are never seen again by the denizens of the mortal world.

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/e3/61/07e361401fb1041456bf0a16033c406b.png' style='float:left;width:45%;padding:20px' />

#### Grandiose Pretense
Fey have a certain effortless arrogance when dealing with mortals. For some it is their lifespan versus the mayfly-like existence of mortals. For others it is their ability to fly or use magic as a part of themselves. For others, it is the sense of transcendent beauty they see in their own realms in comparison to the pale imitations of the mortal world.

Whatever its cause, the more powerful the fey creature, the more deeply ingrained and alien its mindset and the less willing it may be to compromise with the presumptuous and puerile norms of mortals. All fey, however, behave according to their own sets of strictures and laws not immediately apparent to others. For that matter, they often seem contradictory or nonsensical, but are quite rigid nonetheless for creatures often associated with chaos.

#### Whimsicality
Unrestrained by mortality and the restrictions of age, fey indulge their hearts’ desires, and oftentimes do so in haphazard, almost nonsensical fashion. This need not occur because of or in adherence to whatever alien laws dictate some of their actions. Sometimes fey react to a given situation with randomness, spontaneity, and whimsy for the pure joy of spontaneity. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that they don’t act in this manner for the sake of chaos as a concept. They aren’t connected to chaos in the same way a protean outsider is. For the fey, it’s more about amusement than any grand ideology of alignment and cosmological identity.

#### Laying the Proud Low
Linked to their penchant for mischief, fey take particular delight in showing up mortals, particularly mortals of a particularly prideful or haughty nature. The more confident and conceited the mortal, the more enticing a target as far as most fey are concerned. This lends itself well to besting mortals in contests, confusing them with riddles, and making fools of them with bargains replete with exploitable loopholes or impossible conditions. At the same time, this is also a common weakness for these very same fey: they can likewise be supremely haughty and sure of themselves.

#### Love, Pure and Poignant
Given the natural beauty possessed by many fey, it’s easy to understand what mortals see in them. But what do fey see in mortals that would lead them to such intimacy? Looking at mortals’ comparative mayfly lives, an essentially immortal fey could view even a years or decades long tryst as something of no consequence, like a mortal’s one-night stand. Alternatively, they could be amazed at the depth of mortal feelings and response, and the poignancy of such depth in the face of their own impermanence. Depending on how the fey looked at it, their union with a mortal could be meaningless or a life-altering experience.

Sometimes a fey visiting the material world results in a child. No matter if the child is born on the material plane of the feywild, it will have close ties to borth world. Some feel more at home among the fey, some prefer the more grounded life of the material plane, while some change their minds constanty, like fey are inclined to do.

## The Feyblood Class
Feyblood is the name used to describe creatures that have the power of fey coursing through their very being. They might be born from a mortal and fey, could be a mortal who spend such a long time in the feywild that it has changed its soul, powerful and/or wild magic could have infused a mortal with fey power, or it could be an effect from being exposed to a corruption from the feywild.

A feyblood is more than just a mere sorcerer, as it does not only grants some innate magical powers. No, a feyblood is wholly infused not only with the magic, but also the mannnerism, the feelings and the very essence of a fey creature, to such a degree that they are essentially fey themselves.

### Uncanny natures
Feyblood are part and parcel to magic, wielding it with an aptitude that awes druids, inspires jealousy among wizards, and fosters kinship among sorcerers. They often manage the spellcasting abilities most gain after years of discipline by the end of their adolescence, although they often do not yet realize this to be the case. A feyblood’s affinity might express itself as a kinship to earth, water, air, or plants. Others become master manipulators, or inexplicably efficient with an otherwise crude weapon.

### Creating a Feyblood
Perhaps the most important thing when creating a feyblood is to consider whether your formative experiences took place on the Material Plane or in the Feywild.

**The Material Plane**. Did you have a fey ancestor or parent? Fae-blooded folk have subtle signs of their ancestry upon them: unusual pigmentation, an unusual birthmark, an auspicious constellation of freckles, or an imaginary friend even their parents would occasionally swear was real. How and when did you realize your powers, and have you come to embrace them?

**The Feywild**. Few races native to the material plane manage to collectively eke out a living among the harsh wildernesses of the Feywild. They become populations living out of time, surviving in a plane where the only rule is change or die. Tribes embrace this edict of mutability might evolve affectations of variation in pigmentation, hirsuteness, exaggerated ears, or unusually long fingers. You might even sprout wings as you mature. The Material Plane might be a world of alien wonders to you: perhaps you’ve drunk sweet nectar from a tulip, but never tasted refined sugar. Consider the events that brought you to the Material Plane.

</details>
</details>
</details>

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- any simple weapon
- a spellcasting focus
- an entertainer's pack
- a trinket


### Spark
Your Spark symbolizes your connection to the feywild, from where your mystical powers are drawn. Spark is used to fuel your magic and the abilities you can use. On the material plane, your Spark is normally as shown in the Spark columne of the Feyblood class table.

When in the Feywild, your Spark increases by 1, and on other planes it is reduced by 1. This includes the astral and ethereal planes. Your spark can also be reduced by being exposed to your Fey vulnerabilities.

Some feyblood have a greater inner strength and can channel Spark more efficiently. You may use your Charisma modifier instead of the value shown in the Spark column. It is still modified by the plane and vulnerabilities.

<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Long rest |
|:-|
| * Regain use of ***Misty Escape***.
| &nbsp;
| Add the following class specific benefits to choose from: |
| * Regain use of the spells granted by ***Mortal Anchor***.
| * Regain use of ***Dreamchaser***.
| * Regain use of ***Extraplanar Glamour***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Spellcasting
You are a natural conduit for the energies of the Feywild and can manipulate its magic to you will.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know a number of cantrips of your choice equal to you Spark. Since your Spark can change, you should assign the first cantrips to become unavailable if you lose Spark, as well as choose an additional that might become available if your Spark increases.

You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, every time you Spark increases, as shown in the Spark column of the feyblood table.

#### Spell Slots
The feyblood table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain your 2 lowest expended spell slots after a night's rest.

#### Spells Known
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the feyblood spell list. The Spells Known column of the feyblood table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the feyblood spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus or a musical instrument you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your feyblood spells.

#### Spellcasting Modifier
The spellcasting modifier for your feyblood spells is your Spark, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to channel the Feywild into this world.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Spark

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Spark

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### Armor Class Calculations
When the game gives you more than one way to calculate your Armor Class, you can only use one of them. For example, if you have the Glamorous Defense feature and the Lizardfolk’s Natural Armor trait, you can’t benefit from both simultaneously. Instead, you choose which formula determines your AC.

</div>

### Glamorous Defense
While you are not wearing armor or holding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Spark.

### Fey Affinity
You are infused with the magic of the fey and because of that, you have two creature types: humanoid and fey. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types.

In addition you choose a <a href="#internal-affinity">fey affinity</a>, detailed after the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Fey Weakness
A fey creature’s origin often does not prepare them for life upon the material plane, and they may be unaware of their own vulnerabilities. Being exposed to any of these reduced Spark by 1 for 1 minute or until the fey's next round if a save is allowed and successful.

#### Bells
The ringing of iron or silver bells harms any fey who hear them. If a hand-held bell rung 5 ft away from a fey, the sound forces them to make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they take 1d4 thunder damage. If they succeed, they take half the amount. Volume, proximity, size or other enchantments can increase the damage or DC at the DM’s discretion.

#### Citrus Toxicity
Lemons, limes and other citrus fruits are toxic to certain fey. If ingested, the faerie makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned for 24 hours.

#### Dairy Intoxication
Butter, cream and cheese have intoxicating effects on fey. They enjoy the taste and sensation, and must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become intoxicated, with effects similar to alcohol upon humans.

#### Imprisonment
If bound by an iron or silver collar or fetters, or trapped in a container of fine glass or crystal (with a silver or iron flooring or stopper), fey are unable to speak or use material components for spells, use class abilities or break the bonds of their imprisonment.

Once during their captivity a fey can cast the *sending* spell without expending a spell slot, even if they do not know the spell.

#### Metallurgy
Certain alloys can be toxic to fey, most notably cold iron and silver. Against "real" fey, i.e. creatures that are of a fey race, such weapons could have advantage on attack rolls against, or deal additional psychic damage or poisoning an unlucky fey. However, feyblood who do not belong to a fey race, usually only has their Spark reduced if they are critically hit.

#### Vampires
Vampires are pleasantly intoxicated by imbibing fey blood, and consider it a rare delicacy. A vampire that drinks one hit die of fey blood can comfortably withstand direct sunlight for 4d12 hours.

### Faerie Dust
At 2nd level, your body produces a faintly glowing dust, clearly visible to the *detect magic* spell, which can also be used to invigorate yourself or your allies.

Using your ***bonus action***, you can splash dust onto an adjacent creature. The target chooses either to heal for 1d6 hit points + your feyblood level, or immediately make a saving throw against an unwanted poison, disease, or enchantment, adding your Spark as a bonus to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Spark, and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Misty Escape
From 4th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. As a ***reaction*** when you take damage, you can become invisible and teleport up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

You can use this feature once, and regain its use when you finish a long rest.

<!-- 
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above your racial maximum.
-->

### Mortal Anchor
From 8th level you can perform a 1 hour ritual, binding your essence to a present willing living creature that is native to this plane. You can have only one Mortal Anchor at a time, and a creature may only serve as Mortal Anchor for one fey. The bond grants you the following properties:

You can communicate telepathically with your mortal anchor if within a number of feet equal to 5 × your level. Your Mortal anchor has can disable or re-enable or telepathic link using their ***bonus action***.

You can cast the *scrying* and *sending* spell targeting your Mortal Anchor once each without expending a spell slot, even if you don’t know the spells, and may regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Your mortal anchor can choose to succeed a saving throw against these spells.

The bond is an enchantment of the highest level spell a spellcaster of your level can expend. You are aware of any attempts to break it, and may make a DC 14 Insight check to discover the perpetrator.

Your mortal anchor can revoke the bond at any time using their ***action***. When the bond is broken, you must succeed a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or take one level of exhaustion.

### Dreamchaser
At 18th level, you can enter the dreams of others known to you. You can spend 1 minute to compact your faerie dust into a dreamstone, and gift it to another creature. If you create a second, the first crumbles into dust.

If you can see the open sky, you can cast the *dream* spell once without expending a spell slot. If the bearer of your token is the target your *dream* spell, the spell can transcend planes. If they are not asleep, your dream stone will transmit it to the bearer when they fall asleep. Once you cast the spell in this manner, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

### Extraplanar Glamour
At 20th level, your Charisma score increases by 4, to a maximum of 24 (or 4 above your racial max). You also become attuned to another of the inner planes, gaining one of following three boons:

 **Feywild Access**: If you are under the light of a full moon, you can cast the *gate* spell once to access the Feywild or Material Plane without expending a spell slot, and without providing material components for the spell.

 **Astral Access**: You can cast the *astral projection* spell once without expending a spell slot, using a single quartz crystal as the material component for the spell. When you cast the spell, you can only bring a number of additional creatures equal to your Spark.

 **Ethereal Access**: You can cast the *etherealness* spell once without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you can bring an additional number of willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Spark.







## <a class="internal-link" name="internal-affinity">Fey Affinities</a>
Every feyblood is unique: their very natures are shaped by the magic that flows through, but also the experiences that shape and transform them along their journeys. For a feyblood, the development of their powers deforms as they experience a change in scenery, lifestyle and the company they keep. They are famously mutable and can be near unrecognizable at the end of a journey as when it began.

Boggart are feyblood that has the been shaped by fey known to be mischevieous, and love tricks and pranks.

A boggart might be related to one of the following fey creatures. This connection will not only affect their powers, but also their demeanor and outlook.

#### Boggle
Boggles resemble monstrous, gnarled gnomes with grey, blue or purple skin and a pungent odor. They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the Material Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief.

Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, which are annoying but usually harmless. Most boggles are cowards and avoid confrontation or combat. A boggle that feels bested by someone else might offer its services to the being that defeated or cornered it, although precious few are strong-willed enough to get the best out of a boggle’s mischievous compulsions.

#### Dau
Dau are small, agile, and beautiful creatures. Their fey blood keeps them physically fit, even though they generally choose lavish, lazy lifestyles if they can. When dau are able to settle down and enjoy lifestyles of luxury, they always do. Utilizing their magical and deceptive talents only makes their lives easier. Their hedonism attracts many and varied people, offering them even more opportunities to enjoy life. Dau choose not to use their talents to harm or inflict cruelty, seeking rather to enjoy life with others.

Beware, however, those who would breach their rules of hospitality.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### Roleplaying a Boggart
- There is no such thing as something for nothing. Favors for favors, tricks for tricks.
-  Trade insult for insult. Always get the last word, but recognize a good joke, even if you’re the butt of it.

#### Gremlin
As chaotic souls of vague origin, gremlins are generally unwelcome in town. This is just as well to the gremlins, who directly oppose the trappings of civilizations. Gremlins are innately proficient at destroying machinery by finding and targeting weak points. Machinery in this case ranges from expensive military catapults to the lock on your front door.

**Mischievous, yet Analytical**. Inside the mind of a gremlin is a confusing, muddled place. On one hand, gremlins are brilliantly deviant and have a keen eye for assessing physical objects and planning crimes. On the other hand, they are socially inept, dimwitted, and lack the capacity for critical analysis. Simple puzzles stump gremlins that are otherwise quick learners, competent mages, and criminal masterminds.

Gremlins use their analytical minds for hijinks and destruction. They form longstanding grudges with those they detest, and such grudges invariably simmer with spite and malcontent over time. Gremlins start to display their indignation with harmless pranks, but the pranks grow from gags, to intimidation tactics, to outright violence.

#### Leprechaun

> *"Kidnapping? We weren't kidnapping, we were just taking them away, weren't we? Children need to play and you weren't letting them. What? Well of course we're blackmailing you! Those kids were in need of a break! Give them a chance to play and we'll see about letting them go, alright?"*
>
> — Leprechaun Conn Ó Gadhra, to an angry mother.

Leprechauns are a curious folk, hiding in forests and abandoned farms, sometimes benevolent, sometimes friendly. You should be cautious when you run into a leprechaun.

Leprechaun culture mainly revolves around creating shoes and trading or selling them to whichever other creatures happen to live nearby. They also gain money through sneaking into houses and gathering tiny scrapings of gold from various items, eventually forging them into a coin. Over time, leprechauns build up a stash of gold from these two methods, which they generally store in a clay pot known as a crock. The older the leprechaun, the more gold they have in their crock - but also the wilier they become at defending it.

**Mistrusted Folk**. Due to stories of leprechauns tricking people into wild goose chases to find their crock, leprechauns have a somewhat unfair reputation as being untrustworthy, when in truth all they are trying to do is protect their crock. This is reinforced by their reputation of kidnapping children, when in fact the only cases of this have been when leprechauns have adopted children growing up in an abusive or neglected home. These children, on those cases that they are taken, end up gaining leprechaun-like characteristics, and some even become so attuned to this new lifestyle they become a leprechaun themselves.

#### Boggle Oil
As a ***bonus action***, you excrete a non-flammable oil from your skin for 1 minute. You choose whether the oil is slippery or sticky. Both variants grant you resistance to fire damage.

While coated in slippery oil, you have advantage on checks made to escape bonds, squeeze through narrow spaces, and end grapples.

While coated in sticky oil, you have advantage on checks made to grapple and checks made to maintain a hold on another creature, a surface, or an object. You gain a climbing speed of 20 ft.

**Oil Puddle**. While coated in oil, you can use your ***action*** to create a puddle of it, 1 inch deep and covering the ground in a 5 ft radius around you. The puddle is difficult terrain for all other creatures except boggles and lasts for 1 hour.

Saving throw DCs against your oil puddle effects are 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Spark.

If the oil is slippery, any creature that enters the puddle’s area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

If the oil is sticky, any creature that enters the puddle’s area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. On its turn, a creature can use an action to make a new saving throw and extricate itself from the sticky puddle, ending the effect and moving into the nearest safe unoccupied space.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Spark, and regain expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Dau Manipulator
You gain the following abilities:

**Illusory Awareness**. You have advantage on saving throws against illusion magic.

**Magically Deceptive**. You may cast the *detect thoughts* spell. When you reach 3rd level, you may also cast the *mirror image* spell, and upon reaching 5th level, you may cast the *invisibility* spell. You can cast each of these spells once and can regain them after a long rest.

**Tangible Illusion**. Once after casting an illusion spell of an object that is no larger than 5 cubic feet, you can transform it into a normal, non-magical object. The temporary object lasts for 10 minutes after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes if the duration of the original illusion expires).

#### Gremlin Demolitionist
You're an adaptable, chaotic force of destruction and gain the following abilities:

**Demolish**. As a ***bonus action***, you can analyze an object or construct and plan for a crushing blow. The first attack that you hit against the object or construct before the end of your turn is a critical hit. Once you score a critical hit using this feat, you can't use it again against the same object or construct until you finish a long rest.

**Dismantle.** You have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks made to break or dismantle objects. Additionally, you deal extra damage equal to your Spark when you hit an object or a construct with an attack.

#### Leprechaun Luck
You gain the following abilities:

**Cobbler of the Fair Folk**. You gain 1 skill point to spend on ***Craft - Cobbler***. Using your cobbler's tools, you may as an action magically resize any shoe to perfectly fit any humanoid or fey of Medium size or smaller you choose. Once you have done so, you may not resize the same shoe again.

**Lucky**. You gain +2 to your Luck ability score, and when you roll a 1 on the d20 for any roll, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

### Supple Ward
When a ranged spell attack (or *magic missile*) targets a creature you can see within 30 ft, and the results have not been announced, you can use your ***reaction*** and expend an equivalent spell slot to make an opposed spellcasting ability check against the caster.

If you succeed, the spell targets the caster using the original attack roll. You cannot reflect spells cast above 5th-level.

You can use this feature once, and regain it when you complete a long rest.

### Tricksy Cantrip
You can empower one feyblood cantrip you know that targets a single creature.

When you cast the cantrip, you can target one additional creature within range and also within a number of feet equal to 5 × your Spark of the initial target. If the cantrip requires an attack roll, you make a second attack roll.

You can use this feature once, and regain it when you complete a short rest.

### Magical Mimicry
If an ally within 30 ft that you can see and hear casts a spell of 5th-level or lower, with a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action that doesn’t require concentration, you can use your ***reaction*** and an equivalent spell slot to cast the same spell, even if you don’t know it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Nereid are feyblood that has the been shaped by the fey of the waters. You might may have survived a siren’s kiss, or been the unwilling guest of a nixie. Love of water is second nature to you, and those not of the sea often find you cold and distant.

A nereid might be related to one of the following fey creatures. This connection will not only affect their powers, but also their demeanor and outlook.

#### Nixie
A nixie is a small, aquatic fey creature that makes its home in lakes, rivers, and ponds. They often serve as the de facto guardian of their watery homes, normally using trickery and deceit to get rid of intruders, but are not above resorting to violence if such methods prove ineffective. They are also known to charm and enslave humanoids to be their guardians or to perform tasks that require greater strength.

It's worth noting that while most nixies are shy, peaceful creatures, there are some types of nixie that are not. These nixie delight in luring land creatures to their aquatic home and drowning them. They lure their prey by using their incredible beauty, then watch them drown as they enter their underwater home.

#### Siren
These torso of a siren resembles that of an elf, but the lower body resembles a sea creature: iridescent scales and the wide tail of a fish, and sharing other features with sea creatures is not unheard of.

Sirens are blamed for floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings, but many sirens are simple curious romantics. An infatuated siren will risk life and limb to follow it onto land to learn about the object of their desire, assuming an elven visage. Sirens find walking uncomfortable, however, and when they become wet or immersed in water, their body reflexively returns to its native aquatic form.

### Touched by the Waters

If the target is in combat, it automatically succeeds its saving throw.

While charmed, a target is incapacitated. If the target is more than 5 ft away, the tries to move toward you by the most direct route possible, without putting itself in danger. If there is no choice but following a dangerous path, and whenever it takes damage, the charm is broken.

Oread are feyblood that have a strong connection to earth, stone and metals. They feel drawn to a life underground or in stone ruins. Many oread seek solitary lives, greedily hoarding treasures.

An oread might be related to one of the following fey creatures. This connection will not only affect their powers, but also their demeanor and outlook.

#### Korred
Korreds are unpredictable, secretive fey with strong ties to stone. Because of their magical hair and their mystical understanding of minerals, they are sought out by treasure hunters, dwarves and others that desire the wealth of the earth. No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly feel the rise and fall of bedrock under the earth.

Korreds generally prefer to keep their own company, but occasionally consort with creatures of elemental earth, or promising adventurers. Tribes of korreds occasionally gather to perform ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs which can be heard (or felt) for miles underground. They have hair all over their bodies, and the hair that grows from their head is magical, and almost as durable as linked chains of iron. Korreds take great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at anyone who attempts to cut it without permission.

#### Stone Trolls
Stone trolls are horned fey with stony skin. The most ancient of stories make mention of these trolls (although sometimes under a different name). They have a long tradition of joining organizations or groups and protecting them until the end, or they may choose to be the protector of the weak or oppressed, or simple those who fate seems to have abandoned.

This duty-bound nature can put them at odds with an adversary who is all too happy to paint the troll as a monster to be slain, which complicates their repuation. In actual fact, nothing is more important to a troll than their honor. This is both a cultural institution and a supernatural compulsion imposed by their fey nature. A troll who breaks an oath loses some of their strength until they have redeemed themselves.

### Faerie Weapon
When you choose this affinity at 1st level, you gain the ***Light armor*** combat skill and 1 skill point to spend on combat skills. Additionally your fists, teeth, nails or favorite one-handed simple melee weapon become a magical d4 faerie weapon.

You gain 2 additional hit points, and 1 additional hit point each time you gain a feyblood level.

### Oread Magic
Also at 1st level, you learn the *mold earth* cantrip and you gain a climbing speed of 20 ft. If you have a flying speed, you lose it.

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels, shown in the Feyblood Affinity Spells table. These spells are feyblood spells for you, and they don't count against the number of feyblood spells you know.

A pooka is one of the most chaotic and unstable feyblood there is. While most fey and feyblood lean toward the chaotic side, pookas goes towards the wild magic side of chaos, with the expected results of course. The Pooka get their name from the fey creature with the same name.

#### About the creature called Pooka
Pooka resemble small halflings or gnomes with pronounced animal features: eyes, fur, tails, whiskers, paw-like hands or feet, unusual ears, or even tails.

Capricious in nature, pookas are always in search of fun, though they don’t often care who they inconvenience with their antics—they’re just in it for the whimsy. Always chaotic in nature, some pookas are cruel, some are good-natured, and others are slightly unhinged. There’s no way to tell which kind one is just by looking at it; only by interacting with a pooka does its nature become clear.

They have a reputation as liars and mischief-makers, but this lying is, in fact, a kind of language unto itself: the bigger the feeling a pooka has, the bigger the lie they will tell on the subject. Once one knows a pooka well enough to see the truth behind their lies, a lasting friendship can form.

Pookas thrive when in the company of others, and they frequently find companionship in a particular individual whether the camaraderie is wanted or not. They pull pranks to get to know a person and stay invisibly near them to observe the results. As they usually communicate with their unlucky target (whom they call “friend”) using telepathy, the person’s erratic reactions to the unseen pooka’s pranks and mental “voice” can make the target appear insane. The pooka doesn’t mind a little rough retaliation, but flees any attempts to kill it.




### Chaos Magic
When you choose this affinity at 1st level, your spellcasting is a bit unstable and can unleash surges of untamed magic, or as a pooka might say, be more fun. When you attempt to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If your result is 1, or lower than your Luck score, roll on the <a href="#internal-wildmagic"><b>Feywild Wild Magic</b></a> table to create a random magical effect.

In addition, you gain the *zap* cantrip.



You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels, shown in the Feyblood Affinity Spells table. These spells are feyblood spells for you, and they don't count against the number of feyblood spells you know.


#### Feyblood Affinity Spells
| Feyblood level | Pooka Spells |
|:--------------:|:-------------|
| 1st | *chaos bolt, entropic shield*
| 3rd | *chance's grace, shifting the odds*
| 5th | *lucky break, surge dampener*
| 7th | *fumble, wild shield*
| 9th | *extraordinary luck*
| 11th | *chaotic world*
| 13th | *prismatic spray*
| 15th | *paragon of chaos*
| 17th | *touch infinity*


### Luck of the Pooka
A pooka feyblood would be long dead unless they had this incredible Luck, allowing them to survive their own chaos.

At 2nd level, you gain +2 to your Luck score.

In addition, you have a knack of avoiding the havoc you cause. When you roll a wild surge on the regular wild surge table (i.e. not the <a href="#internal-wildmagic"><b>Feywild Wild Magic</b></a> table in this affinity description), you can choose it not to affect you and/or nature around you. When you do, reduce your your Luck by 2. You cannot use this feature if it would reduce your Luck below 0.

If this would cause the surge to have no effect at all, you additionally gain a level of exhaustion.

You can use this feature a number of times equivalent to your Spark.

### Bend Luck
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When you or another creature you can see makes a roll, you can use your ***reaction*** to reroll. You can affect really any roll, including ability checks, damage rolls, wild surges or even a random roll to see how many gp a creature has. You can do so after the rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can bend luck a number of times equivalent to your Spark, and you can regain expended uses when you complete a long rest.









### Glamourous Incorporation
At 10th level, you can absorb a hostile spell, and store the magical energy for your own use. If you are the sole target of a 5th-level or lower spell requiring a saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a Charisma save instead of the one required by the spell. If you succeed, the spell triggeres a wild surge instead, and you regain an expended spell slot, up to the level of the spell you absorbed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

###  Thundering Heroism
At 14th level, wild magic comes effortlessly to you, not even using any of your magical recources. Whenever your Chaos magic feature triggers, causing you to not cast the spell you intended, you regain your lowest level expended spell slot.

A touch of pixie magic is sometimes all it takes to make a mortal into a sidhe feyblood. This influence is usually so strong that the only thing separating a sidhe feyblood from a pixie, is the size and appearance.

#### About the Pixie
There exists a most diminutive people native to the kaleidoscopic wildernesses of the Feywild. They enter our world through secret portals, frequenting the Material Plane’s forest glades, mushroom growths, unique stones or unusual trees, graveyards, barrows and ruins they find appealing for reasons known only to themselves, subtly marking them in ways noticeable to the observant or faithful.

At auspicious moments, murmurations of pixies gather in these areas in a function known as an eisteddfod where they dance, play games, chase, tell tales, wrestle and copulate with one another in dazzling displays of light and flight.

For the most part, the wee folk caution their young against interactions with mortals, but adventurous young pixies make regular travels to the Material Plane all the same, if only to attempt a clever prank that will make a worthy tale at the next eisteddfod.

Prestige is everything to a pixie: their short seasons and long years are an endless game of acquisitions and losses played among their tribe, or troop. They are taught to defend territory with ferocity, when a tactical retreat will serve them best, and how to exact revenge upon those who wronged them. Throughout this education, a strong sense of fair play is stressed, and cunning and creativity are considered virtues.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### Roleplaying a Sidhe
* A clever alliance can overcome any obstacle.

* You are the wind blowing at your friends’ backs.

* Moods, desires and fancies are like the weather: they come in wide varieties and are bound to change.

A feyblood whose connection to the Feywild manifests as a closeness to nature is called a Sprig. This is usually due to influence by the magic of the dryads, whether through direct contact or through family entanglement in the affairs of the fey. You have a special influence over plants and the forests that others cannot hope to match. You are less capricious than many other feyblood, the dryad influence lending itself more to shyness and subtlety.

#### Dryads
Dryads dedicate their long lives to watching over, caring for, and living within trees, woods and forests and caring for the beasts that inhabit it. Visitors to their forests would do well to not act foolishly around any tree inhabited or protected by a dryad.

Sylphs have been shaped by the influence of the more hedonistic fey, like satyrs, or nymphs. For them, the natural world resounds with countless melodies few can hear, often moving them to song or dance. Their instincts move them to surrender to their passions, as restraint requires discipline they often lack.

Even if not outwardly beautiful, they retain a touch of the unearthly about them, and their presence carries weight with others. They tend to be flighty and capricious though not cruel.

A sylph is most commonly connectes to the powers of nymphs or satyrs. This connection will not only affect their powers, but also their demeanor and outlook.

#### Nymph
The nymph is a fey creature of unfathomnable beauty. The spirit of natural beauty made flesh, they inhabit beautiful natural regions, and spend their days gazing at the wild beauty that they embody.

As the incarnation of the highest ideal of beauty, nymphs are hard to define physically. Few have seen them without going blind or risking death at the prospect. The quality they all share, however, is that they are incredibly, painfully beautiful, alluring and charming in every possible way.

Nymphs lead solitary existences, but rarely desire much in the way of interaction, they find that others despoil them by their mere presence. Nymphs despise ugliness in all its forms, whether good or evil, and often seek to eradicate it. A nymph's definition of "ugly" may be fairly extreme, as well, a maiden many find beautiful may disgust a nymph.

#### Satyr
Satyrs are lean and furry. Men and women alike sport longer hair and shave only to sculpt, and never to hide their hirsute affectations. Their strong, fur-covered legs resemble those of a goat, sheep or deer, and antlers or tight curled horns protrude from their foreheads. They are passionate sensual beings, many of whom do not know the concept of restraint. The few clothes they wear are durable and- more importantly- easily removed.

While passion is something satyrs understand innately, most do not grasp the emotional bond that comes with lust. They rarely keep a partner for long, which, while normal to them, can bring terrible heartache to their lovers.

Music and storytelling are prized skills among satyrs, and many pursue careers related to music. Clubs, pubs, bars, and breweries are potent attractors to them. With their store of impressive stamina, jobs requiring hearty individuals also suit satyrs nicely.




### Revelry and Passion
The spirit of these fey allows you to enjoy rampant hedonism without consequence. Starting when you choose this affinity at 1st level, you suffer no adverse health effects from excessive drinking, such as hangovers or weight gain (although you can still become intoxicated). Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against paralysis and exhaustion.

When you make direct physical contact with a humanoid or fey, you can use your action to attempt discern their surface thoughts and emotional state. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw against your spellcasting DC, it is under the effect of the *detect thoughts* spell by you while you remain in contact with them, and you also learn the creature’s alignment.

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels, shown in the Feyblood Affinity Spells table. These spells are feyblood spells for you, and they don't count against the number of feyblood spells you know.


#### Feyblood Affinity Spells
| Feyblood level | Sylph Spells |
|:--------------:|:-------------|

While displaying your beauty, if a humanoid starts its turn within 30 feet of the you and can see you, as an ***action*** you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically blinded. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A humanoid that isn’t surprised can attempt to avert their eyes.

You can use this ability once, and regain expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, your land speed increases by 10 feet and you can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

**Charge**. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller creature and then hit it with your horns, the target must succeed a Strength saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be pushed 5 feet away from you or knocked prone (your choice). You can then use your ***bonus action*** to make a melee attack.

If the creature fails a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

### Pandemonium
From 10th level, you can cast the *confusion* spell without expending a spell slot or providing material components for the spell. You can do this a number of times equal to your Spark, and can regain expended uses of it when you complete a long rest.

Additionally you can expend a use to cast the spell at a higher spell level, e.g. spend two uses to cast it as a 5th level spell, 3 uses to cast as it as a 6th-level spell and so on.

### Enchanting Gaze
Starting at 14th level, whenever a creature within 20 ft you attacks you, you may use your ***reaction*** to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. This save is made with disadvantage if you or your companions has attacked it during the last round.

On a failed save, the creature gains the charmed condition for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration. At the end of each of its turns, and whenever the charmed creature takes damage, it may repeat the saving throw to end the effect. On a successful save, the creature is immune to your Enchanting Gaze for 24 hours.
