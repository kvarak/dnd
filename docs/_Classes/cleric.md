> *"I have been fortunate enough to have experienced more in these few years than most have in their entire lifetime. Even so, nothing can ever replace the feeling of warmth, grace, purity, and power, all of which come to me each time I call upon Sarenrae to guide my hand."*
>
> — Alisa Tristane, priestess

Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.

Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric — someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity’s power.

The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one’s deity, thereby attracting the god’s favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn’t matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.

#### Deity
One of the most important things to decide is the deity you serve. The Golarion setting hosts a large pantheon of deities, ranging from the all-powerful greater deities to the minor gods and demigods, who are mostly powerful extraplanar creatures. While most deities' followers span cultures and races, some races and intelligent creatures have their own pantheons worshiped primarily within their own ranks.

A description of the most common deities in Golarion, as well in a more generic setting, can be found *<a href="#Deities">here</a>.* This also includes the allowed domains for each deity.



## Cleric Class Features
As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** All simple weapons

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Check your background for skills. In addition you gain proficiency with the Religion skill.

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a mace or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* scale mail, *(b)* leather armor or *(c)* chain mail (if proficient)
- *(a)* a priest’s pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- a holy symbol
- (if proficient) a warhammer, a shield, a light crossbow and 20 bolts








### Divine Domain
Choose one domain related to your deity. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, 10th, and 18th levels.

#### Favored Domain Spells
Whenever you gain access to a new cleric spell level, select two of the ones listed as domain spells. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. This does not apply to spell levels above 5th.

### Path of Faith
Different clerics uphold their faith in different ways. Decide the path you have chosen between the Path of the Missionary, Priest or Saint.

 **Crusader**. You are a frontline warrior, using both magic and metal to bolster your allies. Whenever you make an attack with a melee weapon you are proficient with, you may use your Wisdom modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Additionally, you gain proficiency with martial weapons, medium armor and shields.

 **Missionary**. You are but a mouthpiece for your god, to both gain more followers and tell of their superiority. You have proficiency on Charisma checks when deceiving, intimidating, impressing, persuading or speaking in the name of your god. In addition, when make such a check, you may use your Wisdom modifier rather than Charisma.



 **Priest**. You focus on using the spells your deity has gifted you, aiding your allies from the back. When calculating AC you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier. You learn an additional cantrip from your spell list.

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned with another cantrip from your spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells up to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

</div>




You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. However, if you do not have your maximum number of spells prepared, you can add a new spell to your list of prepared spells at any time. Both these activities requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each new spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity.

**Spell save DC**  = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier**  = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasing Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with Turn the Unholy, an effect based on your  Path of Faith, and one or more effects determined by your domain. Some domains also grant more effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

#### Piety
In order to Channel Divinity, you have to spend 4 ***Piety***. The amount of piety you have per level is shown in the Cleric table.

*See the Rest Additions for more details.*

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy
When you gain this feature, choose two creature types from the following: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead.

As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer against your chosen creature type. Each creature of that type that can see or hear you within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.




<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.


#### Crusader
<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Channel Divinity: Devastating Strike
When you hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your channel divinity to fuel your strike. You deal additional damage equal to 5 + twice your Cleric level. The type of extra damage is dependent on your domain, and is the same as the type of damage your 8th level feature does.


#### Missionary
<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Channel Divinity: Words of Honey
When you make an ability check or saving throw using Wisdom or Charisma, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.


#### Priest
<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Channel Divinity: Aura of the Gods
As an ***action*** you present your holy symbol to project an aura emanating from you. The aura is has a 30 ft radius, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the aura, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:
* You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.
* You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.


### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1.

You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.








### Faithful Path
At 8th level, you gain an additional feature depending on your path of faith.

 **Crusader**. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target. The type of damage and any other effect will be described in your domain description.

 **Missionary**. Whenever you make a check with a skill you are proficient in, you may add 1d4 to the check.

 **Priest**. You may add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Faithful Path
At 14th level, you gain an additional feature depending on your path of faith.

 **Crusader**. The extra damage increases to 2d8.

 **Missionary**. You learn any 2 skills of your choice.

 **Priest**. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that only targets allies, you may cast a Cleric cantrip as a ***bonus action***. The 1st level or higher spell cast must have used your action.

### Divine Intervention
Finally at 20th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. As an ***action*** you may call upon your deity for direct aid, upon doing so, roll 1d4, consulting the results below for what happens.

1. You replicate the effects of any spell of 9th level or lower from your spell list. You do not require components for this spell, and it can not be counterspelled or dispelled if its duration is 1 minute or less. If its casting time is greater than 1 action, it becomes 1 action for this specific casting. If the spell cast is lower than 9th level, it is cast at 9th level for the purposes of higher level effects.



2. Your deity sends a loyal servant to aid you. Your DM chooses a creature of the Celestial, Fey or Fiend type that would be appropriate, however its CR can be no greater than 20. The creature is an ally to you and assists you in any way it can, it leaves when it is reduced to 0 HP or after an hour has passed. The DM may rule the creature remains for a longer duration.

3. Your deity restores your energy. You and up to 6 creatures of your choice within 120 ft of you immediately gain the benefits of a long rest.

4. Your deity merges your being with its own, granting you significant power. You immediately recover all your HP and expended spell slots, and you immediately end any effects on you of your choice. Additionally, your AC increases by an amount equal to your wisdom modifier, and your HP maximum increases by your wisdom modifier times 20. These benefits last for an hour or until your deity decides to end it early.

Once you gain aid from your deity, you can not do so again until 7 days have passed.

### <a name="Celtic">Celtic Deities</a>
It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak - and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell.

They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into  being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.



### <a name="Egyptian">Egyptian Deities</a>
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at - the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods with the Death domain of different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. Thus, although most clerics of the Death domain are villainous characters, clerics who serve Anubis or Nephthys need not be.

### <a name="Norse">Norse Deities</a>
Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring - this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did.



Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.

The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families sometimes have overlap in their spheres of influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) are both associated with the sun, for example.

# <a name="Domains">Divine Domains</a>
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity's domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.

Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus ("radiant") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius ("healing"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain.

Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.

Choose one domain related to your deity. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 10th, and 18th levels.

#### Domain Spells
Each domain has a list of domain spells. Whenever you gain access to a new cleric spell level, select two of the ones listed as domain spells. The selected spells are always prepared, and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

#### Faithful Path
If you have chosen the path of the Crusader, your divine domain decides what type of damage your Faithful Path features deals. A few domains also have choices for other Paths.

# <a name="Agriculture">Agriculture Domain</a>
Gods of the field and farm share much with the gods of nature. They are nurturing forces, lifebringers and survivors. Unlike their more wild cousins, however, gods of agriculture cultivate nature, sculpting it to their needs.

They teach the art of farming and animal husbandry to mortals, giving them stability, peace, and the opportunity to grow. Simultaneously, they train their followers in the ways of cooperation and hardiness - perfect traits for the reluctant warrior, and ideal traits for a shepard who protects villages and towns that would be otherwise defenseless.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Plentiful Harvest |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Shared Burden |
| 6th |  Hand of Solidarity |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Gestalt Anchor |
| 18th | Simple Resilience |


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you take this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with farming implements, land vehicles, and on agriculture related checks.

Furthermore, you can use well-maintained farming implements as weapons with which you are proficient. These use the stats of the weapon that most closely matches their shape and weight.

### Plentiful Harvest
Also at 1st level, you gain the *goodberry* spell, which is always prepared. Additionally, your healing strengthens those who benefit from it. Whenever you heal a creature for 5 or more hit points using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, that creature gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage with weapon attacks until the beginning of your next turn.

### Channel: Shared Burden
You can use your Channel Divinity to protect your allies using the strength of your shared bonds. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to choose a number of other willing creatures you can see (which can include yourself), up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Distribute the damage dealt between the original target and the chosen creatures however you like. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, the damage can't be reduced in any way, and each creature involved must take at least 1 damage.



### Hand of Solidarity
From 6th level, you can invoke your divine power to lift your allies to new heights in battle. You can take the Help action as a ***bonus action***.

Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, you can help two allies targeting the same creature within range. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Gestalt Anchor
Starting at 10th level, you can lend providence to your allies when they falter against foes. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to add your Wisdom modifier to the roll, potentially turning it into a success.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Simple Resilience
Starting at 18th level, your spells bolster your target even when already at their peak condition. Any time you heal a creature with a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and the amount of healing rolled would put the target over their hit point maximum, the creature gains those excess hit points as temporary hit points.

These hit points last for 1 minute, and give the creature advantage on all saves as long as they remain. Healing a creature who is missing no hit points and already has temporary hit points from this feature wastes the spell slot with no effect.

# <a name="Arcana">Arcana Domain</a>
Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit. The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Arcane Initiate |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Harness Power |
| 6th | Spell Breaker |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Rapid Arcana |
| 18th | Arcane Mastery |


### Arcane Initiate
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

### Channel: Harness Power
Att 2nd level you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a ***bonus action***, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus.



### Spell Breaker
Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is force damage.

### Rapid Arcana
Beginning at 10th level, you have learned how to quicken your arcane casting. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on your turn that only targets allies, you spend a Piety to cast a cantrip as a ***bonus action***.

### Arcane Mastery
At 17th level, you choose four spells from the wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.








# <a name="Balance">Balance Domain</a>
For every light, there is a shadow equally dark. It is in this balance between the forces of chaos, law, good, and evil that the mortal races can live and thrive. Such is the order of things, and thus, that balance must be protected.

Among the gods, there is often the tie-breaker, the traitor, the peace-bringer and the judge. Pharasma, Calistria, Anubis, Bast and Forseti, as well as other gods of justice, balance, equilibrium, vengeance, and peace may hold sway over the domain of balance.

Your task, as an arbiter of these ancient gods, is to maintain the balance of the cosmic order by quelling what threats are within your power. Bring ruin where it is needed, and salvation where there is none to be found.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Mystic Inversion |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Weigh the Scales |
| 6th | Harmony in Unity |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Balancing Act |
| 18th | Perfect Order |


### Mystic Inversion
At 1st level, you learn to balance the cosmic energies with your spellcasting, counteracting the excesses of others. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change one or more damage types from that spell to a different damage type, according to the following chart, by switching the damage type to its opposite.

For example, when you cast *flame strike*, you can change the fire damage to cold damage, the radiant damage to necrotic damage, or both.

#### Damage type inversion table

| Damage type | Damage type |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| Fire | Cold
| Acid | Force
| Psychic | Poison
| Necrotic | Radiant
| Slashing/Piercing | Thunder
| Bludgeoning | Lightning



### Channel: Weigh the Scales
At 2nd level, you can use your ***action*** and your Channel Divinity feature to impose equilibrium. For one minute or until you choose to end this effect as a bonus action, you cannot gain advantage or suffer disadvantage, and you can reroll any damage dice that result in a 1, but only once per die.

### Harmony in Unity
At 6th level, your divine calling allows you to correct what has been disrupted. When you cast a spell that causes a creature to regain hit points, that creature’s next attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, you can choose the extra damage you deal to be radiant or necrotic. You can change this choice at any time.

### Balancing Act
From 10th level, if you are affected by Weigh the Scales, you are also considered to be affected by *protection from Evil and Good*.

### Perfect Order
At 18th level, your god controls the events around you, acting with inscrutable intent. When a creature takes an action within 30 feet of you and rolls a d20, you can choose the result of the die roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# <a name="Celebration">Celebration Domain</a>
Your god is an awesome god, and one who loves to throw excellent parties. Cayden Cailean, Bacchus, Dionysus, Hanseath, and any god known for alcohol or other intoxicants, wild behavior, and good cheer could have celebration as one of their domains.

Your primary task is to raise the spirits and embolden the hearts of those around you, but your deity may task you with pursuing other ends - bringing peace to a war-torn land, freeing those brought low by the yoke of oppression, standing firm against the tides of war, and performing noble deeds that are always met with a good celebration!

Not all deities of this domain are so benevolent, however. Praise for gods of war and conflict after a successful battle are just as common in war torn lands, as drinking wine from the skull of an enemy is a treat for any vicious warlord.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Cantrip, Life of the Party |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Firework, Channel Divinity: Water and Wine |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Cheerful Assistance |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | More Time for Celebration |
| 18th | Grand Finale |


### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the *dancing lights* cantrip if you don't already know it. You do not need to maintain concentration on this cantrip, and you can create a number of lights equal to the normal value plus half your cleric level rounded up.

### Life of the Party
Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.

Whenever you cast a cleric spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier that last for one minute.



### Channel: Firework
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure a small explosive, which you can throw into any space within 60 feet as an ***action***. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of the target point must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn. The firework emits a loud boom that can be heard up to 300 feet away.

### Channel: Water and Wine
Also from 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to transform up to fifty gallons of water into a magical ambrosia for one hour. Creatures that drink from this must make a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC or be charmed for one minute.

Either way, the subject gains temporary hit points equal to your cleric level. This liquid can be bottled, but fades back into water after one hour.

### Channel: Cheerful Assistance
At 6th level, you can protect your friends from bad decisions. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see makes a roll with disadvantage, you can use your ***reaction*** and Channel Divinity feature to enable them to roll with advantage instead.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is fire or radiant.

### More Time for Celebration
At 10th level you gain 8 additional Piety.

### Grand Finale
Starting at 18th level, when you make a ranged attack or cast a cantrip that targets only one creature, you can cause the projectile or the cantrip to explode in a shower of sparks. Each creature within a 5-foot radius centered on the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your cleric spell save DC or take damage as if also targeted by the attack or cantrip.








# <a name="Chaos">Chaos Domain</a>
The Chaos Domain is the concern of gods that shuns the idea of laws and order, embracing chaos, change, progress, and entropy. Although they are often perceived as a threat or dangerous by those in power, many of these gods act as the voices of the people who cannot be heard, as well as the catalysts for revolutions against corrupt empires and others who would enslave and oppress.

Some chaotic gods act as forces of unchecked chaos, destroying everything in their path and sowing madness and decay wherever they go. Others are the embodiment of the power within the Elemental Chaos, manifesting in endless turbulence and perpetual change, who bring both ruin and creation in equal measure.

Followers of these gods can be many things, such as heroic revolutionaries, amoral renegades, or powerful wielders of elemental chaos.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Chaotic Manifestation |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Entropic Surge, Channel Divinity: Power of the Maelstrom |
| 6th | On the Side of Chaos |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | riend of Fickle Forces |
| 18th | Winds of Madness |


### Chaotic Manifestation
At 1st level select two of the following manifestations of chaos. You can use each manifestation a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


#### Deliberate Discord
You are able to sow chaos wherever you go. Whenever a creature that you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On failure, the creature must redirect their attack against another creature or object of your choice within the attack’s range.

#### Fury of the Abyss
As a ***bonus action***, you can give yourself advantage on melee attacks, melee damage rolls, and combat maneuver checks. This bonus lasts for 1 round. During this round, any attacks against you have advantage.



#### Locus of Chaos
Your god's unpredictable nature can infuse your spellcasting with chaos. Whenever you cast a cleric spell of 1st level or higher, you can spend the spell slot as normal, but the spell's effects are treated as if the spell had been cast at the next higher level spell slot. When you use this ability, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect.

### Channel: Entropic Surge
From 2nd level you can invoke the power of your deity to alter the weave in disorderly ways. As a ***reaction*** when a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can present your holy symbol to cause the spell to fail, and the creature must roll on the Wild Surge table with disadvantage.

### Channel: Power of the Maelstrom
Also from 2nd level you gain the ability to conjure the maelstrom of the elemental chaos.

As an action, an explosion of chaotic energy targets each hostile creature within 30 feet. A creature takes damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed Dexterity saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. Roll the type of damage for each target individually according to the Maelstrom Damage Table.


#### Maelstrom Damage Table
| d8 | Damage type | d8 | Damage type |
|:--:|:------------|:--:|:------------|
| 1	| Acid 	| 5	| Lightning
| 2	| Cold 	| 6	| Poison
| 3	| Fire 	| 7	| Psychic
| 4	| Force | 8	| Thunder


### On the Side of Chaos
Starting at 6th level, whenever you are affected by a spell or effect that has a random effect (e.g. confusion, entropic shield) or use an item with unpredictable effects (e.g. Wand of Wonder, or Deck of Many Things), you make rolls or selections with advantage.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is determined with a roll on the Maelstrom damage table.

### Friend of Fickle Forces
From 10th level, when you are forced to make a saving throw, you can choose to  make that saving throw with advantage. If you do, you must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.

Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.








### Winds of Madness
At 18th level, your god manifests their power in full through your actions. As an ***action***, you can unleash a massive burst of chaotic energy. All creatures within a 30-foot radius must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, their ties to causality are disrupted.

Whenever the creature takes an action, they must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. This disruption lasts until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# <a name="Charm">Charm Domain</a>
Deities whose portfolios include the Charm domain govern over the ability to control others either through charismatic presence or through enchantment magic. They include deities of beauty, art, pleasure, courtship, love and fertility as well as lust, control, deceit and enchantment magic.

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to enthrall other creatures. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and speak a hypnotic prayer. Each creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.

If a creature fails it's saving throw, it gains the charmed condition for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

### Instinctive Charm
Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On failure, the creature must redirect their attack against another creature or object of your choice within the attack’s range. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.

On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.



### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

If you have chosen the **Path of the Missionary** or **Path of the Missionary**, you can choose the Split Enchantment feature instead of the usual feature.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

# <a name="Death">Death Domain</a>
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder, pain, disease, poison and the underworld.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Reaper |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Negative Energy |
| 6th | Inescapable Destruction |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Embrace Death |
| 18th | Improved Reaper |


### Reaper
At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

### Channel: Negative Energy
You can use your Channel Divinity to release a wave of annihilative energy. As an ***action*** on your turn, you cause every creature within 30 feet, other than constructs and undead, to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + half your cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. An undead within this range instead regains hit points equal to the total.



### Inescapable Destruction
Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is necrotic or poison.

### Embrace Death
Beginning at 10th level, your body has taken on some of the beneficial aspects of undeath without suffering the consequences. You gain resistance to necrotic and noison damage. Additionally, you only age 1 year for every 10 that pass.

### Improved Reaper
Starting at 18th level, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for each target.








# <a name="Desert">Desert Domain</a>
Gods of the sands and burning sun, deities of cloudless nights and storms of cutting wind, masters of the scorching heat and lords of the desert all call this domain their own. Often as merciless as the lands they claim, many are jealous and generous in equal measure. Clerics of these deities often escort travelers, seek forgotten relics, hunt criminals, and war for peace.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Nomadic Endurance |
| 2nd | Channel Divinit: Sandstormy |
| 6th | Dune Walker |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th |Shifting Sands  |
| 18th | Endless Expanse |


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with deserts, including its flora and fauna, and how to survivie in it.

### Nomadic Endurance
Also from 1st level, your god blesses you with the resilience to survive the harsh landscape of the desert. You can go for a number of days equal to your cleric level without food before suffering ill effects, and you gain advantage on saving throws against exhaustion from desert conditions. You can see through smoke, fog, dust, swirling sand, and other obscuration caused by gasses.

### Channel: Sandstorm
At 2nd level, your god enables you to control the greatest danger in the desert. As an ***action***, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to unleash a raging whirlwind of tearing sand in a 60-foot line that is 20 feet wide. The area becomes heavily obscured by a cloud of dust until the start of your next turn.

Creatures of your choosing within the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. If they fail, they are blinded until the end of your next turn and take 1d6 slashing damage per two cleric levels you possess. If they succeed, they are not blinded and take half as much damage.

### Dune Walker
At 6th level, your god blesses you with the dance of the fearsome serpents of the desert. You can use a ***bonus action*** to teleport up to your movement speed to a location you can see, disappearing in a flash of sand and reforming from dust at the target location. You cannot move and use this action during the same turn.



When you teleport using this feature, you can use your ***action*** to cause a cloudy burst of sand to appear, heavily obscuring a 10-foot radius around you until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the deadliest scorpion venom and the razor-sharp sands upon the wind. The extra damage you deal is poison or slashing.

### Shifting Sands
From 10th level, when you cast a cleric spell of 1st level and higher that requires concentration, you can conjure a gust of wind that surrounds you for 1 minute or until your concentration on the spell is broken.

The gust of winds creates a small vortex centered on you, out to a radius of 5 feet. When a hostile creature first enters the area within the vortex or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.

### Endless Expanse
At 18th level, your god's domain grows and spreads beyond its borders. You ignore difficult terrain while in desert environments, and gain resistance to fire damage.

You can also cast *hallucinatory terrain*. When you do so, the area appears to be transformed into a desert, and becomes hot and dry. Creatures of your choosing within the area suffer exhaustion as though exposed to extreme heat. When you cast this spell, you can choose to also cast *conjure animals*; it does not require concentration and has a duration of 10 days.

Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

# <a name="Fate">Fate Domain</a>
Diviners and wizards often attempt to peer at the threads that bind the lives of mortals, but gods are the ones who weave those threads with every new birth and death. The deities of death, glory, time, judgement, luck, and prophecy call upon their clerics to act as oracles and seers of fate and future - and to intervene when the time is right.

Those who follow benevolent gods often guide heroes to their destinies, while evil oracles may lead them astray or attempt to meddle with the future to bring prophecies of ruin, destruction and chaos to fruition.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Eye of the Oracle |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Severed Threads |
| 6th | Cryptic Advice |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | More Cryptic Advice |
| 18th | Prophetic Glimpse |


### Eye of the Oracle
When you choose this domain at 1st level, your god bestows a mark upon you that signifies your attunement to the threads of fate, such as a third eye, runic tattoo, or halo of mist, which you can conceal at will.

While your mark is revealed, you can use your ***action*** to gaze into the future of another person. Until the end of your next turn, your first skill check, attack roll, or saving throw regarding the target is made with advantage.

### Channel: Severed Threads
At 2nd level, your god grants you the ability to manipulate fate directly. Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you can use a ***bonus action*** and your Channel Divinity feature to attempt to cut its ties to mortality.

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, their fate is disrupted: they have disadvantage on the next three rolls they make (ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws).



### Cryptic Advice
Starting at 6th level, you can give a piece of cryptic advice to a creature you share a language with. When that creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check during the day they can recall your cryptic advice to reroll the die, using the second result instead.

Once a creature has used you Cryptic Advice, it cannot use it again until it completes a long rest.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, you gain the ability to cut directly into the past and future simultaneously. The extra damage you deal is psychic.

### More Cryptic Advice
From 10th level, a creature can benefit from an additional Cryptic Advice after the first one has been used.

### Prophetic Glimpse
At 18th level, your god grants you the ability to see brief yet perfectly accurate visions of the future. You can choose to activate this feature at the start of your turn.

Record all actions you and others take and the results of rolls made during your turn. If you are satisfied with the results of the events that took place at the end of your turn, this feature ends, as your vision is fulfilled exactly as specified.

If you are not satisfied at that time, you can choose to defy the vision, reverting all events back to exactly how they were at the moment that you declared your use of this feature.

Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

# <a name="Forge">Forge Domain</a>
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamondtipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object.

Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Blessing of the Forge |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Artisan’s Blessing |
| 6th | Soul of the Forge |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Behemoth |
| 18th | Saint of Forge and Fire |


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith’s tools.

### Blessing of the Forge
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical armor, shield, or weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC (if it is an armor or a shield) or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls (if it is a weapon).

### Channel: Artisan’s Blessing
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.



The item you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge  grants you a number of special abilities:
* While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* You gain resistance to fire damage.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, you do not deal extra damage. Instead, you learn to channel your divine power into a frenzy of weapon strikes. Once on each of your turns when you take the Attack action, you can make an additional weapon attack as part of the same action. If you hit with this additional attack, you can cause all of the attack's damage to become fire damage.

When you gain your second Faithful Path power at 14th level, you can instead make a second additional attack, which you can also convert to fire.

### Behemoth
Beginning at 10th level, your flame and spirit is an unbreakable defense. You have resistance to nonmagical fire, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

### Saint of Forge and Fire
At 18th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:
* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.








# <a name="Fortune">Fortune Domain</a>
Gods of luck, fortune, and chance are venerated by those individuals that rely on cosmic intervention to make their way through the world, often using the symbol of a coin. Most of these gods embody good luck or random chance, though there are some deities that revel in misfortune. All of them seem attracted at some level to the daring and bold, but they also seem drawn to unknown or undiscovered things, because such things often lead to greater destinies or adventure.

Luck is every adventurer's best friend, so it is no wonder that gods of fortune and chance are popular among those that regularly risk their lives for fame and fortune.

Although at first glance this domain seems to overlap with Trickery, it is actually quite distinct. A luck god throws the dice; a trickster god tries to weight them.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Fortune's Friend  |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Aura of Misfortune |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Surge of Fortune |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Bend Luck |
| 18th | Impossible Luck |


### Fortune's Friend
Beginning at 1st level, you are unnaturally good at things in which you are not skilled. Once per turn when you make an ability check you are not proficient with, you can choose to roll with advantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel: Aura of Misfortune
Starting at 2nd level, by using a ***bonus action***, you can use your Channel Divinity to drain the good luck from your adversaries. All living, hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your cleric spell DC or suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks until the end of their next turn.



### Channel: Surge of Fortune
From 6th level, by using a ***bonus action***, you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse yourself or a an ally within 30 feet with good luck. Until the end of your next turn, you or the ally has advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is of the same type dealt by the weapon.

### Bend Luck
Starting at 10th level, you have the ability to twist luck. When you or a creature you can see makes a roll, you can use your ***reaction*** to reroll. You can affect any roll, including ability checks, damage rolls, wild surges or even a random roll to see how many gp a creature has. You can do so after the rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Impossible Luck
Starting at 18th level, you can use your ***action*** to surround yourself with an aura of perfect chance. For 1 minute or until you dismiss the aura using another action, you have advantage on all saving throws against effects that deal damage, and all attack rolls against you are made at disadvantage.

# <a name="Hunting">Hunting Domain</a>

*Run all you like. For you cannot hide.*

-- Garmos Saernclaws, Prophet of Malar

The Hunting domain focuses on the sacred link between hunter and prey, a relationship that ties mortals to nature. The gods of hunting represent far more than the mere pursuit of animals or the skills and equipment involved. They signify both the hunt for justice, such as tracking down an enemy who was wronged you or your community, and the sacred spiritual quest that reveals wisdom.

A god of the hunt who is evil emphasizes the power of the hunter, who uses superior strength, cunning, and skill to kill and take what they wish. A good god of the hunt encourages a village or tribe dependent on hunting a certain animal for food to see those animals as their mystical kin, not as prey, and to be careful not to hunt more than they need. Divine patrons of the hunt are more often female than male, and are often tied to forests, seasons (especially autumn), and the moon as well. Like rangers, clerics of this domain walk the frontier between civilization and the wild.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Slayer’s Arrow |
| 6th | Living Wind |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Natural Resistance |
| 18th | Unerring Hunter |


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with all ranged martial weapons and the Survival skill.



### Channel: Slayer's Arrow
At 2nd level, your god teaches you to attack the soul of your quarry. As an ***action***, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to launch an ethereal arrow or spear, striking all creatures in a line up to 200 feet long and 5 feet wide, that passes through walls and obstacles.

Struck targets must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they take magical piercing damage equal to 2d6 plus your cleric level and are knocked prone. If they succeed, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.

### Living Wind
At 6th level, the winds of the wildlands come to your call. Whenever you cast a single-target cantrip or attack with a weapon, you can use a ***bonus action*** to move up to your speed towards your target. When you do so, ranged and opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is of the same type dealt by the weapon.

### Natural Resistance
At 7th level, due to repeated exposure to nature, your body’s resistance has increased. You gain proficiency with Constitution saving throws.

### Unerring Hunter
At 18th level, you become immune to the effects of difficult terrain and gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed.

You can choose to have your Slayer's Arrow turn up to three times during its flight and the first creature struck takes additional force damage equal to your cleric level if they fail their saving throw. Each creature cannot be struck more than once per use of this feature.








# <a name="Knowledge">Knowledge Domain</a>
The gods of knowledge value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Blessings of Knowledge |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Knowledge of Ages |
| 6th | Invasive Knowledge |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Divine Expertise |
| 18th | Visions of the Past |


### Blessings of Knowledge
At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or any other (normally) Intelligence-based knowledge skill.

Whenever you make a check using one of your chosen skills, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier.

### Channel: Knowledge of Ages
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an ***action***, choose one skill or tool. For 1 hour, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.

### Invasive Knowledge
Beginning at 6th level, you can invade other people's privacy in order to gain more knowledge. As an ***action*** you can open up your senses to read a creature's mind, as long as it is within 30 ft and you can see it.

This mind-reading functions as per the *Detect thoughts* spell, but you can only read surface thoughts and can't probe deeper.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.



### Divine Expertise
At 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. You have advantage on any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

### Visions of the Past
Starting at 18th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

 **Object Reading**. Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

 **Area Reading**. As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

# <a name="Life">Life Domain</a>
The life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy - one of the fundamental forces of the universe - that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities, sun gods, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Disciple of Life |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Mend Wounds |
| 6th | Blessed Healer |
| 8th | Faithful Path |

| 18th | Supreme Healing |


### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Medicine skill.

### Disciple of Life
From 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

### Channel: Mend Wounds
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.



### Blessed Healer
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Attuned to Life
From 10th level, the energies of life fill your body. You have advantage on saves to against effects reducing your hp maximum and are immune to disease. However, your immunity is not absolute. Your capability to withstand a disease depends on its strength.


#### Magical Immunity

|:-------------:|:---------|
| 10-12 | Diseases up to DC 15
| 13-15 | Diseases up to DC 20
| 16-18 | Diseases up to DC 25
| 19-20 | All diseases


### Supreme Healing
Starting at 18th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.








# <a name="Light">Light Domain</a>
Gods of light promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Warding Flare |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Radiance of Dawn |
| 6th | Improved Flare |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Guided by Light |
| 18th | Corona of Light |


### Warding Flare
Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature that you can see within 30 feet, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel: Radiance of Dawn
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled.

Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.



### Improved Flare
Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet attacks a creature other than you.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Guided by Light
Once you reach 10th level, the lights guidance no longer makes you wince. You gain resistance to radiant damage, and you are immune to the blinded condition caused by light.

### Corona of Light
Starting at 18th level, you can use your ***action*** to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

# <a name="Nature">Nature Domain</a>
Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Acolyte of Nature |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity |
| 6th | Dampen Elements |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Speech of the Wild |
| 18th | Master of Nature |


### Acolyte of Nature
At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain two additional ways to use your Channel Divinity.

 **Charm Animals and Plants**. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.




 **Nature's Bounty**. You can use your Channel Divinity to bestow blessings of the wild upon your allies. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity, selecting up to five friendly creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creatures all gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 hour:

 * The creature gains a swimming speed of 30 feet, and it can breathe underwater.

 * The creature gains a climbing speed of 30 feet, and it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

 * The creature gains resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against poison.

### Dampen Elements
Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant ***resistance*** to the creature against that instance of the damage.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is cold, fire, or lightning.

### Speech of the Wild
From 10th level, your speech becomes infused with the natural energies of the world. You are considered to always be under the effects of the *Speak with animals* spell.

### Master of Nature
At 18th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a ***bonus action*** on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.








# <a name="Ocean">Ocean Domain</a>
Standing upon the shore and staring into an endless expanse of water for the first time can be a religious experience for some, and certainly is for those who are called to service by a god of the sea. These clerics pursue a wide variety of goals; from calming the waves so that fishermen may survive to summoning terrible monsters from the deep.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Navigator's Eye, Waves on the Shore |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Anchor of Faith |
| 6th | Blood in the Water |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Sailor of Trackless Waters |
| 18th | Call of the Sea |


### Navigator's Eye
When you take this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with navigation and as a sailor . You also gain proficiency with rapiers, scimitars, and short swords.

### Waves on the Shore
At 1st level, your god's power comes to you from the tidal pools and shallows, and from the chitinous creatures that dwell there. You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

While under water, you can choose to have your base AC equal 13 + your Constitution modifier, as transparent chitin plates form over your skin to protect you. While these plates are present, you can cast spells, act, and breathe normally while underwater.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

#### Octopus Face
Your appearance doesn't have to be chitinous. The hide of a shark or stingray can be just as durable and provide a different style of armor for Waves on the Shore.


### Channel: Anchor of Faith
Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke your deity to hinder the unfaithful. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and invoke a spiritual anchor chained to a target you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failure, the creature is chained to the spiritual anchor for 1 minute. While anchored, the creature's speed is halved, and it cannot move or be moved more than 20 feet from the anchor without a successful Strength check.



### Blood in the Water
At 6th level, your god grants you the fearsome curse of the deadly predators of the seas. Whenever you suffer damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to mark one creature you can see with a black, bleeding splotch upon their skin. While a creature is marked, you are aware of its exact location if you are on the same plane. You can only mark one creature at a time using this feature. Marking a new creature erases any previous mark.

If you can see the target, and it is in water, you can use an ***action*** to call a spiritual swarm of undersea predators to attack them and those around them. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, the predators strike them and all other hostile creatures within 15 feet of them, inflicting 3d10 psychic damage. If they succeed, the splotch fades and the effect ends.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is cold.

### Sailor of Trackless Waters
At 10th level, your skill at navigating improves so that you cannot become lost except by magical means, as long see the stars.

### Call of the Sea
At 18th level, your summons to the ocean is as strong as it's call to your heart. You can cast *wall of water* and *control water* without expending spell slots.

In addition, you gain resistance to cold damage and immunity to exhaustion from swimming or other oceanic conditions and activities.








# <a name="Order">Order Domain</a>
The Order domain represents discipline, as well  as service to a society or an institution, whether that service is rendered in obedience to or  enforcement of the law—civil, religious, or both. Gods on many worlds grant access to this  domain, including Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.

The ideal of order is obedience to the law  above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular  rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action’s results are just. Following the law  and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their deities. More importantly, law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Voice of Authority |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Order’s Demand |
| 6th | Embodiment of the Law |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Commanding Inspiration |
| 18th | Order’s Wrath |


### Voice of Authority
Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of law to drive an ally to attack. Immediately after you cast a spell on an ally using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, that ally can use their ***reaction*** to make one weapon attack. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

### Channel: Order’s Demand
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or gainm the charmed condition until the end of your next turn or until it takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.



### Embodiment of the Law
At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others. If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to a ***bonus action*** for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally an action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Commanding Inspiration
Starting at 10th level, as an ***action*** you can speak to a creature within 30 feet that can hear you, to end one effect on that creature that is causing them to be charmed or frightened.

### Order’s Wrath
Starting at 18th level, enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 1d8 psychic damage and the curse ends.

# <a name="Protection">Protection Domain</a>
The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods’ faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind.

Deities whose portfolios include the protection domain are often deities that also have Life and War in their spheres of control, but also deities that have a penchant for feeling protective of certain followers or of certain aspects of life such as agricultural deities or deities that consider themselves patrons of a society or race.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Shield of the Faithful |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Stalwart Defense |
| 6th | Blessed Healer |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Protective Bond |
| 18th | Indomitable Defense |


### Shield of the Faithful
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to hinder attacks intended for others. When a creature attacks a target other than you, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, you must be adjacent to both the attacker and the target. You interpose an arm, a shield, or some other part of yourself to try to throw the attack off target.

### Channel: Stalwart Defense
You can use Channel Divinity to shield an ally. As an ***action***, you may target a creature within 60 feet, placing a ward on them for 1 minute. The first time the creature takes damage while having this ward, that damage is reduced to 0, and the ward disappears.



### Blessed Healer
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others can heal you as well. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to any creature other than you this turn, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Protective Bond
From 10th level, you can forge a protective bond among allies. As an ***action***, you choose a number of willing adjacent creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (this can include yourself). You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While a bonded creature is about to take damge, a second bonded creature within 10 feet of the first can use its ***reaction*** take all the damage instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Indomitable Defense
At 18th level, you gain resistance to two damage types of your choice, choosing from bludgeoning, necrotic, piercing, radiant, and slashing. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can change the damage types you chose.

As an ***action***, you can temporarily give up this resistance and transfer it to one creature you touch. The creature keeps the resistance until your next short rest or until you transfer it back to yourself as a ***bonus action***.

# <a name="Repose">Repose Domain</a>
Many gods of the dead watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead’s rest, is an abomination.

The Repose domain is one of righteous protection against the most unholy of forces: undeath. It channels the power of Good- and Neutral-aligned deities to guide wayward souls and ghosts into the next plane of existence, helping them leave the material plane. When those spirits are uncooperative, or worse, are evil and malign, adherents of this domain are given the power to punish them and banish them to the depths of the hells or abyss.

Followers of these deities also seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, but also ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Eyes of the Grave, Ferryman's Mercy |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Positive Energy |
| 6th | Sentinel at Death’s Door |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Keeper of Souls |
| 18th | Not Your Time |


### Eyes of the Grave
At 1st level, as an ***action***, you can sense the presence of the undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet not behind total cover.

### Ferryman's Mercy
Also from 1st level, you stand as a warden at the Black Gates of death, keeping nearby allies out of the grave. You project an aura of stygian vigilance that extends 10 ft from you. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.

When a creature within your aura is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a Wisdom check. The DC equals 10 or half the damage the creature took, whichever number is higher. If you succeed, the creature is reduced to 1 hit point instead, and you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



### Channel: Positive Energy
You can use Channel Divinity to release a wave of positive energy. As an ***action*** on your turn during combat, you cause every creature within 30 feet of you, other than constructs and undead, to regain hit points equal to 2d6 + half your cleric level. An undead within this range must instead make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, taking radiant damage equal to the total on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Sentinel at Death’s Door
At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a ***reaction*** when you or a creature within 30 feet that you can see suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is necrotic or radiant.

### Keeper of Souls
Starting at 10th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When you see an enemy within 60 feet die, as a ***reaction*** you or one creature of your choice within 60 feet regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice.

### Not Your Time
Once you reach 18th level, you are able to declare when it is not someones time to die. When a creature within 120 ft of you would be killed by unnatural means, you can use your ***reaction*** to prevent that death. The creature is instead rendered unconscious and stabilized. While unconscious this way, they are immune to all damage and can not regain any hit points. This stasis ends after 1 hour, upon which they regain 1 hit point.

Upon using this feature, you can not use it again until you complete a long rest.

# <a name="Strength">Strength Domain</a>
As a worshipper of a god of physical might, you are dedicated to performing feats of strength and despise weakness. You are granted various magical abilities related to using, bestowing, or depleting athletic ability. For you, their somatic components tend to involve flexing, shadow boxing, or pounding the floor until it shakes.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Mighty Voice |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Burst of Strength |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Behemoth |
| 18th | Overpowering Might |


### Bonus Proficiency
At level 1, you gain proficiency with Athletics and in the use of all heavy melee weapons. Further, you may choose to have proficiency with Strength saving throws instead of Charisma.

### Mighty Voice
From 1st level, you may use the voice-amplifying effect of the cantrip *thaumaturgy* at any time, without expending an action to cast it.

### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain two additional ways to use your Channel Divinity.

 **Beast of Burden**. As a ***bonus action***, you may use Channel Divinity and touch a creature; for one minute, their carrying capacity increases tenfold and they can lift, push and drag objects up to ten times more than the usual weight, so long as those objects are free to move and are not part of any larger object.



 **Strength to go on**. You can use Channel Divinity to ameliorate fatigue and reinvigorate your allies. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol, and choose any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet. Each chosen recipient regains a number of spent Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Channel: Burst of Strength
Starting at 6th level, whenever you start your turn grappled or restrained, you may use your ***reaction*** and your Channel Divinity to end the effect. If you were restrained by a physical device, you break it.

Further, whenever an effect would forcibly move you some distance or knock you prone, you may use your ***reaction*** and Channel Divinity to remain still and upright; if the effect was the result of a melee attack, the attacker is instead pushed backwards the distance they attempted to push you, or knocked prone if they attempted to knock you prone.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is bludgeoning.

### Behemoth
Beginning at 10th level, your strength is an unbreakable defense. All non-magical damage is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Overpowering Might
Starting at 18th level, when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to attempt to shove or grapple it, regardless of its size.








# <a name="Survival">Survival Domain</a>
Clerics and shamans of primitive tribes living in harsh environments have no greater mission than ensuring the survival of their tribes. The gods of survival often have other domains in similar realms, such as life or nature. The worshippers who work within the Survival domain, however, are much more primal and brutal than their counterparts.

The gods of primitive and uncivilized races are most likely to hold this domain: lizardfolk god Semuanya and orc goddess Luthic are prime examples of deities whose clerics embrace the Survival domain. They are more likely to remain in their territories, nurturing and protecting their flocks, but fighting fiercely when a threat invades their lairs.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Stand the Fallen |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Encourage the Troops |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Push the Limits |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Natural Resistance |
| 18th | Protection of the Tribe |


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Survival and Nature skills.

### Stand the Fallen
Also starting at 1st level, when you cast the *spare the dying* cantrip, you can make the following changes to the spell: change the range from touch to 30 feet, and the creature gains 1 hit point instead of becoming stable.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



### Channel: Encourage the Troops
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to bolster the fighting abilities of your allies. As an ***action***, you present your holy symbol and invoke the survival instincts of your deity. Each allied creature that can see you gains advantage on their next melee or ranged weapon attack before the start of your next turn. If their attack hits, the allied creature also regains hit points equal to your cleric level.

### Channel Divinity: Push the Limits
From 6th level, you can use Channel Divinity as an ***action*** to strengthen the resolve your allies. All allied creatures within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your cleric level.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is of the same type dealt by the weapon.

### Natural Resistance
At 7th level, due to repeated exposure to nature, your body’s resistance has increased. You gain proficiency with Constitution saving throws.

### Protection of the Tribe
Starting at 18th level, you can use an ***action*** to make one allied creature who you can see immune to damage for a short time. The chosen creature is immune to all damage until the start of your next turn. You can regain the use of this ability when you finish a long rest.

# <a name="Tempest">Tempest Domain</a>
Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices to ward off divine wrath.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Wrath of the Storm |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath |
| 6th | Thunderbolt Strike |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Stormborn |
| 18th | Unyielding Storm |


### Wrath of the Storm
Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers. When an adjacent creature hits you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



### Channel: Destructive Wrath
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to unleash the wrath of your deity. Each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage can be your choice of lightning or thunder, you choose when using this feature.

### Thunderbolt Strike
At 6th level, when you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is lightning or thunder.

# <a name="Time">Time Domain</a>
The Time domain deals with the flow of time. Few deities offer access to this domain, as it is quite esoteric and dangerous to tamper with. In some games, there may be powerful rituals usable by clerics with this domain that allow creatures or objects to travel into the past or future, or to move sideways through time into parallel worlds with different histories, while in other campaigns, any sort of time travel might be forbidden or even impossible.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Moment of Pause, Time is at your side |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Choose Future |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Stall |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Delay Damage |
| 18th | Relentless Touch of Time |


### Moment of Pause
As a melee spell attack, you can stop time for one creature briefly, freezing them in place. For one round, the creature can take no action and experiences time as if that round never took place. Because the target of this ability does not experience the flow of time it cannot be affected by any event, attack, spell or effect as per the time stop spell.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.

### Time is at your side
Also at 1st level, you gain advantage on initiative checks.

### Channel: Choose Future
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see a momentary vision of the branches of time just before you make an attack or check. As a ***bonus action***, you channel the powers of time in order to gain advantage on the attack or check.



### Channel: Stall
Starting at 6th level, you can use Channel Divinity to briefly slow time around another creature. As a ***bonus action***, you may force a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, their AC is reduced by 2, they have disadvantage on attacks, Dexterity saving throws and cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is necrotic.

### Delay Damage
Starting at 10th level, your ability to manipulate time is so precise you're able to freeze it for a fraction of a second to avoid danger. When you would normally be hit by weapon or spell attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to stop time long enough to get out of harm's way. The attack misses and fails to affect you, and you move to a location within 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Relentless Touch of Time
At 18th level, as an ***action***, you can call upon the power of entropy to cast *disintegrate* by touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# <a name="Trickery">Trickery Domain</a>
Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Blessing of the Trickster,<br> Improved Minor Illusion |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows |

| 10th | Malleable Illusions, Trickster’s Majesty |
| 18th | Soul of Deceit |


### Blessing of the Trickster

### Improved Minor Illusion
Also at 1st level, you gain the *minor illusion* cantrip if you don’t already know it. When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

### Channel: Invoke Duplicity
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As an ***action***, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet. As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.



### Channel: Cloak of Shadows
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an ***action***, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is poison or psychic.

### Malleable Illusions
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an illusion that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your ***action*** to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.

### Trickster's Majesty
Also from 10th level, as an ***action*** you may swap places with your duplicate created by Invoke Duplicity. Your duplicate no longer requires concentration and now lasts for an hour.

### Soul of Deceit
Starting at 18th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.








# <a name="Vengeance">Vengeance Domain</a>
The domain of vengeance, revenge, avengers, retribution and retributive justice - a fiery force that fuels many. Vengeance is worthwhile when server with great passion and swift justice. Deities whose portfolios include the Vengeance domain govern over all forms of revenge and vengeful justice whether of good intent or out of hatred. They include deities of hatred, strife, jealousy, murder, poetic justice, revenge, ethical balance and justice, defense of personal honor, as well as deities that don't shy from the undead in the form of revenants.

Clerics such as you act as warriors and killers, harbingers of the doom and destruction of those who have killed and destroyed in turn. Call upon the fury of righteous revenge, and bring low those who have trespassed against you.

| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Instrument of Revenge |
| 6th | Fly Havoc |

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Vengeful Counter
Also at 1st level, your deity enables you to strike those who harm your allies. Whenever an allied creature you can see takes damage from an attack and the attacker is within your reach, you can make a melee attack against the creature as a ***reaction***.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel: Instrument of Revenge
At 2nd level, you can call upon the power of your deity to grant a vengeful blessing to those who have been hurt. When you see a friendly creature take damage from another creature, you can use Channel Divinity with  your reaction to bless the creature.



For the next hour, the target always knows the location of the creature that damaged it, the target’s weapon attacks against this creature deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage, and whenever the creature takes an action that the target can see, the target can use its reaction to move up to its speed towards the creature.

### Fly Havoc
At 6th level, your deity grants you the wings of an avenging angel. You can use your ***bonus action*** and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, to cause wings to appear at your back. These wings pass harmlessly through armor and equipment but are hard as steel, granting you a flying speed of 60 feet and the benefits of the *shield* spell. The wings remain for a number of rounds equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### No Mercy
From 10th level there is no longer a limit to how many times you can use your Vengeful Counter feature.

### Vengeful Visions
At 18th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly cause the target to relive terrifying phantasmal visions of their past deeds. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmarish landscape within the Shadowfell.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space and takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

# <a name="War">War Domain</a>
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage, and gods of conquest and domination. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiency, Faith and Steel |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Battle Hymn |
| 6th | War God’s Magic |

| 10th | Behemoth |
| 18th | Avatar of Battle |


### Bonus Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Faith and Steel
Your studies mix martial training with theological study, making you as much warrior as priest. You learn one Fighting Style option of your choice from the fighter class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different.

Additionally, if proficient, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.



### Channel: Battle Hymn
At 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to deliver a bolt of inspiration to a warrior engaged in battle. As a ***bonus action***, you touch your holy symbol and choose one willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you, other than yourself. Once before the end of the creature's next turn when it takes the Attack action, it can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action

### War God's Magic
Starting at 6th level, divine magic fuels your attacks. When you cast a cleric cantrip using your action, you can make one weapon attack as a ***bonus action***.

### Faithful Path
At 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, you do not deal extra damage. Instead, you learn to channel your divine power into a frenzy of weapon strikes. Once on each of your turns when you take the Attack action, you can make an additional weapon attack as part of the same action. If you hit with this additional attack, you can cause all of the attack's damage to become radiant damage.

When you gain your second Faithful Path power at 14th level, you can instead make a second additional attack, which you can also convert to radiant.

### Behemoth
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

At 18th level, you gain resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.








# <a name="Winter">Winter Domain</a>
Winter is a time of both cold brutality and togetherness, and Winter clerics often epitomize one or both of these principles, leaving the dead to lie buried in snowdrifts, or saving a village of people beset by dark tidings. People may turn to these clerics for warm comfort in troubled times, or to be instruments or dark, remorseless wrath against those that are affronts to their gods.

Gods and goddesses of Winter usually have radically different ideas of what their domain means, and pass their specific dogma onto their followers. Some see the winter’s colds as a cleansing or a dying-off time, while others champion the brutal, survivalistic focus that winter brings, focusing on the struggle for life that exists within the snows. Of course, clerics of Winter readily adopt these philosophies, and ensure they are put to practice as the clerics wander the wider world.

Deities whose portfolios include the Cold domain govern over all aspects of the physical cold and ice, winter, frost, elemental ice and creatures associated with ice and those who dwell in cold and icy environments such as the northern reaches and high mountains.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Frost’s Fortitude |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Cold Snap |
| 6th | Rime |
| 8th | Faithful Path |
| 10th | Glacial Wreath |
| 18th | Blizzard |


### Frost’s Fortitude
At 1st level, winter’s power grants you endurance and strength where others would falter. You take no penalties and suffer no damage from mundane cold environments or weather.

### Channel: Cold Snap
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to wreath those who oppose you in the fury of winter, instantly freezing them to the ground where they stand. As an ***action***, you may present your holy symbol and call upon the wrath of your deity.

All creatures within a 10 foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails this saving throw becomes frozen in place for 1 minute. That creatures is grappled until it breaks free; the DC to escape this grapple is equal to your spell save DC.



### Rime
Starting at 6th level, you can rime with frost those who would dare strike you or your allies. When a creature within 30 feet that you can see attacks you or any other creature, you may use your ***reaction*** to chill the attacking creature with a torrent of arctic power, slowing their movements and draining their fortitude.

Until the end of the affected creature's next turn, its movement speed is halved, it makes Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks with disadvantage, and the first Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw the creature makes has disadvantage. If a creature affected by this ability is hit with an attack, it takes additional damage from that attack equal to your Wisdom modifier. This ability has no effect on creatures with immunity or resistance to cold damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and can regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is cold.

### Glacial Wreath
From 10th level, you can conjure sheats of ice to protect yourself. After you are dealt damge by an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to gain temporary hit points equal to half your cleric level, which last until the beginning of your next round.

### Blizzard
Starting at 18th level, you can unleash the might of your deity in a powerful flurry of ice and snow, engulfing your foes in a raging snowstorm.

As an ***action***, you conjure a powerful blizzard that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration. The blizzard is centered in a point you can see within 120 feet, which occupies a 120 foot tall cylinder with a 100 foot radius. The area is heavily obscured to all creatures, other than a number of creatures of your choice you can see up to your Wisdom modifier.

Creatures starting their turn within the blizzard (other than those you have designated) must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If a creature fails, it is subject to your Rime ability without expending any of its uses, and takes 4d6 cold damage. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage are not affected by Rime, as normal.

You can dismiss this blizzard as a part of any other action. You can use this once and can regain its use when you finish a long rest.

# <a name="balancedScale">Balanced Scale of Abadar</a>
Balanced scales of Abadar fulfill a specialized role, especially in Katapesh. In addition to utilizing their powers of mercantilism, balanced scales seek out lost, unclaimed, or wrongly seized wealth among the many tombs and ruins of the Katapesh desert. Balanced scales of Abadar develop unique powers that afford them the ability to enter dangerous areas where lost treasure can be restored to the light or hidden goods can be returned to their rightful owners.

A balanced scale finds the most satisfaction in discovering long-lost treasures hidden in unmarked strongholds, owned by now nameless individuals of the past. A balanced scale can claim such wealth for her own and use it to further the strength of her church.


#### Domain Features
| Cleric Level | Feature |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bonus Proficiencies, Bypass Ward |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Bottomless Bag |
| 6th | Channel Divinity: Access the Vault |
| 8th | Potent Spellcasting |
| 10th | Unfailing Logic |
| 17th | Vault Jump |


### Bonus Proficiencies
A balanced scale must estimate value quickly and accurately, particularly when in a dangerous environment such as an underground tomb. When you select this domain at 1st level, you have proficiency with appraising and comparing values of objects, and you always have advantage on such checks

Also, getting permission to enter treasure-laden ruins sometimes requires talking to the right people and handing around a few coins for bribes, “finder’s fees,” and so on. You learn which palms to grease and what promises to make, and may add your proficiency bonus on such checks.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled when you offer an appropriate bribe (minimum 10 gp × the level of the recipient) during the interaction, as well as on Charisma checks made to compel a bound creature to perform a service when using the *planar binding* (and similar) spell.

### Bypass Ward
Ancient ruins often contain locked and sometimes warded doors which needs to be passed. Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with Thieves’ tools. By expending a 1st level spell slot, you can temporarily suppress a magic ward on a door for 1 minute, including both magical locks and trap glyphs.



### Channel: Bottomless Bag
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to temporarily turn any ordinary container into a bag of holding.

As an ***action***, you turn any ordinary sack, backpack, or other container into a bag of holding. The container remains a bag of holding for 1 hour per cleric level; after the duration expires, the container resumes its normal properties, and any items too large to fit within its true dimensions immediately and harmlessly fall out of the opening. Unlike a permanent bag of holding, the bag created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured, nor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces.

### Channel: Access the Vault
Starting at 6th level, you can use Channel Divinity to access the First Vault, Abadar’s planar repository for perfect versions of every item ever made.

You can summon a copy of any one nonmagical item as long as its market price is equal to or less than 500 gp per cleric level and its volume is less than 1 cubic foot per cleric level. The item remains for 1 minute per cleric level, after which it returns to the Vault.

Items taken from the First Vault are obviously of exceptional quality and radiate magic, and their unearthly perfection is enough to make any potential buyer suspicious. The church of Abadar frowns on selling items from the Vault, as it is essentially stealing from the buyer (as the items vanish shortly thereafter), which disrupts faith in fair trade and the church.

Balanced scales who abuse this ability lose access to all their class abilities until they have atoned for their transgression.

### Faithful Path
From 8th level, if you have chosen the **Path of the Crusader**, the extra damage you deal is radiant.

### Unfailing Logic
Your experience teaches you to anchor yourself in reality, granting resistance to even the most potent illusions. You gain advantage on saving throws against illusions.








### Vault Jump
Those who drive hard bargains and search for lost treasures sometimes bite off more than they can chew, and a quick exit is often the only way to escape a bad situation alive.

At 18th level, you can create a one-way portal through the First Vault, which has one of two effects. First, you may use the portal as if it were a *teleport* spell. Second, you may use the portal as if you were casting *word of recall*, but instead of returning to a sanctuary, you always returns to the closest active temple of Abadar.

You can do this once, and this use recovers when you finish a long rest.
