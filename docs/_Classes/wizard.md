# Wizard

Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals.

While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.

> *"No wizard will ever take offense to a polite round of applause from the rest of the party after a particularly well-crafted spell."*

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- *(a)* a quarterstaff or *(b)* a dagger
- *(a)* a component pouch or *(b)* an arcane focus
- *(a)* a scholar’s pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- A spellbook

### Arcane Tradition
When you become a wizard, you choose the arcane tradition in which you have been taught, shaping your practice of magic.

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Spellcasting
You gain the ability to cast magic spells through careful study of spellbooks, glyphs, and arcane sigils.

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook into which you can record your known spells and arcane research.

See the Spellbook section after the class description for more details about your spellbook.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three random cantrips from the wizard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

 **Memorable**: Cantrips are simple enough for you to memorize—they don't need to be recorded or prepared.

 **Replacing Cantrips**: Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned with another cantrip from your spell list.

</div>

#### Spells Known
At 1st-level, you know six 1st-level spells from your class spell list, that you were taught during your training. Assign them randomly and write them into your spellbook. In addition you may add one spell of your choice.

 **Recorded knowledge**. Spells of 1st-level and higher are too complicated to be memorized by mortal minds and you have to write them in your spellbook to keep them recorded.

 **Learning new spells**. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

 **Finding spells**. In addition, you may find other wizard spells — such as on scrolls and in spellbooks — on your adventures. If you can decipher their script, you may be able to write them into your own spellbook.

<img src='https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/6/357/420/618/636272696881281556.png' style='float:left;width:20%;padding:20px' />

#### Preparing Spells
You must prepare the list of spells that you can cast, choosing from your list of recorded wizard spells.

 **Preparing your spell list**. You prepare the list of spells available to you from your spellbook. To do so, choose a number of spells up to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Changing prepared spells**: You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. However, if you do not have your maximum number of spells prepared, you can add a new spell to your list of prepared spells at any time. Both these activities requires time spent studying your spellbook and the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Casting Spells
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your prepared spells. To cast a spell, you expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.

Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, and you regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your spellbook or an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

### Arcane Recovery
Between long rests, you can recover some expended spell slots by studying your spellbook for 10 minutes. The spell slots must have a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

You can use this feature once, and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Bonus Skill
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you gain an additional skill point to spend on your class skills.

### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot.

When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.



<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-spellbook">Spellbooks</a></h2>

No self-respecting wizard is a wizard for long without a spellbook of their very own -  a  priceless tome in which to record spells and arcane knowledge. The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might also find other spells during your adventures.

### Your Spellbook
Your spellbook is a unique tome with its own decorative fourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

#### Magical capacity
Magical writing is inherently powerful, and stacking multiple spells together in close proximity — such as in a spellbook — can have unpredictable consequences. A single spellbook can safely hold up to 50 spell levels worth of spells and arcane knowledge. Each page must be specailly treated to be able to hold the power.

 **Capacity Burnout**: If your spellbook capacity is exceeded, your spellbook will purge itself and erase content at random until balance is restored.

#### Copying a Spell into the Book
When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours of uninterrupted work and costs 5 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

When copying spells where you wrote the original, it takes 1 hour and costs 1 gp per spell level.

#### Other spellbooks
If you find another wizard's spellbook, and can read it, you can choose to attune to it as if it were a magic item. Doing so, you can use it to prepare spells as if it were your own.

### Making a New Spellbook
As a wizard, you may be required to make a new spellbook for yourself—to replace a lost book, to expand your magical capacity, or to use as a backup copy of an existing spellbook.

#### Crafting a Spellbook
If you are trained in *Arcana* and *Art - calligraphy*, you can create a new spellbook by infusing a normal book with 25 gp worth of arcane materials. This requires 1 day of dedicated effort and attention, and the process turns 50 pages of the book into pages that can handle the arcane power of spells.

Note that this does not actually require a book, so you could do the same to a loose pile of pages, prepare leather to recive spells or even prepare sticks or rock to be used as spells receptacles.

### Unusual spellbooks
While every wizard has a spellbook, the spellbooks themselves can range in design, shape, and quality of material.


#### Example spellbooks
| d10 | Spellbook |
| :-: | :-------- |
| 1 | A tome with pages that are thin sheets of metal, spells etched into them with acid.
| 2 | Long straps of leather on which spells are written, wrapped around a staff for each of transport.
| 3 | A battered tome filled with pictographs that only you can understand.
| 4 | A collection of smooth pieces of wood or stone, etched with arcane designs and symbols that are kept in a leather pouch.
| 5 | A bundle of metal or wooden rings or charms, connected to one circular loop, bracelet, or necklace, upon which spells are written on the inner and outer parts of each ring.
| 6 | A tome full of black pages whose writing is visible only in dim light or darkness.
| 7 | A collection of small, thin wooden boards inscribed with arcane runes, strung together on a thick rope that dangles from the waist.
| 8 | A collection of scarves, upon which are stitched special designs that signify spells.
| 9 | A collection of arm, chest, or leg wraps that are bound tight across the body, inscribed with your spells.
| 10 | A collection of crystals, each embedded with spells in the form of mystical etchings, that you keep in a special box or bag.



<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-traditions">Arcane traditions</a></h2>

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-unseenHand">Master of the Unseen Hand</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Improved Mage Hand
| 2nd | Telekinetic Wielder
| 6th | Practiced Mage Hand
| 10th | Mind over Matter
| 14th | Telekinetic Maelstrom

</div>

While some wizards simply use the *mage hand* cantrip, others pride themselves in being experts with it. By specializing in this simple cantrip, these wizards turn themselves into forces of telekinetic power. They become able to lift heavier objects, wield weapons telekinetically, and fling their enemies into the air.

### Improved Mage Hand
When you adopt this tradition, you gain the *mage hand* cantrip. Its range improves to 60 ft and its strength improves to 20 pounds. If you already have the *mage hand* cantrip, you gain one other cantrip of your choice from your spell list.

### Telekinetic Wielder
You can use your mage hand as an offensive force, by directing it to pick up any melee weapon and fight as you command it. This action requires concentration. By using your attack action, you can direct your mage hand to make an attack with the weapon it is holding. Resolve this as a spell attack, with the weapon's base damage + your Intelligence modifier as damage.

#### Mage Hand Combat Notes
* You no longer threaten the squares around you, but the armed mage hand threatens the squares around it.
* Your armed mage hand cannot be attacked, except to be disarmed. Resolve disarm checks with your Intelligence modfier.
* If you are proficient with the weapon, you may add your proficiency bonus to the attack.
* Your mage hand must hold a weapon to attack. It cannot attack unarmed.

### Practiced Mage Hand
Your mage hand becomes an extension of your own. Its range increases to 90 ft and its strength to 30 pounds. Directing your mage hand or using the Telekinetic Wielder class feature becomes a ***bonus action***. You may use your Telekinetic Wielder class feature as both as an attack action and a bonus action, allowing you to attack twice with your mage hand.

### Mind over Matter
Gain the ability to cast *levitate* at will. Additionally when you use your Telekinetic Wielder class feature you deal an additional 1d8 force damage with the weapon.

Add the spells *Bigbys hand* and *Telekinesis* to your spellbook if you don't have them already.

### Telekinetic Maelstrom
You can use your prowess of telekinesis to do one of the following things as an action:

* Levitate a creature up into the air and drop it. The target cannot weigh more than 500 pound and may resist the effect with a successful Strength save. Otherwise you can lift it up to 50 ft straight up into the air and let it drop for 1d6 falling damage for every 5 ft it fell.
* Cast the spell *Bigby's hand* without using a spell slot.
* Cast the spell *Telekinesis* without ѵsing a spell slot.
* Violently hurl objects within 30 ft from you in a 30 cone in any direction. This deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 5d6 force damage to all creatures within the cone.

After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.







<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-astromancy">School of Astromancy</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Astrological Augury, North Star
| 2nd | Spell Stars
| 6th | Realign
| 10th | Greater Star
| 14th | Constellate

</div>

Astromancy is the magical science of deriving meaning and power from the relationships and movements of celestial bodies such as planets, comets, stars and the sun. Wizards who practice this tradition are known as astromancers, astronomers or astrologers, the terms being interchangeable in most circles. They study the different properties of the celestial bodies, and learn to create their own miniature replicas, infused with the power of the constellations.

### Astrological Augury
During a night when you can see the stars, you can perform an hour-long ritual with your astrologer's tools to study the omens you see in the stars and learn how to avoid a coming disaster.

You gain an Augury die, a d6. When you or a creature you can see rolls a saving throw, you can roll the Augury die and add the number rolled to a saving throw. You can wait until after the d20 is rolled before deciding to use the die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Augury die is rolled, it is lost. Your Augury die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 6th level and a d10 at 14th level.

In addition, as long as you can see the night sky, you know exactly where you are relative to the closest landmark with which you are familiar and your group can't become lost except by magical means.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

##### Astrologer's Tools
40 gp, 2 lbs

Astrologer's tools enable a character to chart the progress of the stars and other heavenly bodies.

 **Components**. Astrologer's tools include a star chart, a compass, calipers, a quill, ink, and parchment.

</div>

### Spell Stars
You can conjure forth tiny stars when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. When you do so, choose an unoccupied space within range of the spell, and a spell star appears at the point for 1 minute. The spell star provides bright light in a 10 ft radius and dim light for an additional 10 ft.

A spell star has in it a fraction of the powers from a constellation of your choice, described below. You can have a number of spell stars at once equal to half your wizard level, and only one constellation of each type.

Each constellation has a *Channel* power that affects creatures of your choice within its bright light (i.e. 10 ft radius), as well as a Release power which you can choose to activate when you dismiss a spell star. Unless otherwise noted, effects only last as long as targets are within the light.

### Realign
You learn to shift your stars as you desire. As a ***bonus action***, you can move a spell star within 60 ft of you up to 30 ft in any direction. If you ram the spell star into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 radiant damage and the spell star disappears. It does not trigger its release power this way.

### Greater Star
You can use a ***bonus action*** to empower one active spell star to greater effect. Its greater channel effect is in addition to the normal benefit. You can use this ability twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest.

### Constellate
You can channel your arcane energy to create a constellation in an instant. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a number of spell stars equal to the slot level, placing each star at a point you can see within 60 ft of you.

### Constellations
You can channel the powers of the constellations through your spell stars. The school of astromancy uses the Zodiac called The Cosmic Caravan as an aid for their focus. The Cosmic Caravan is a zodiac containing thirteen constellations and it is strongly associated with Varisia, but has its roots in Azlanti astrology.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### The Thrush
    As the first constellation of the year, the Thrush is seen as a herald of the other signs, welcoming them with open wings.

    **Channel**. You can copy the *Channel* effect of any other spell star currently in sight. The effects are not cumulative.

    **Greater channel**. You can copy the *Greater Channel* effect of any other spell star currently in sight. The effects are not cumulative.

    **Release**. The duration of all spell stars in sight is reset.

- ### The Lantern Bearer
    The serpentine angel known as the Lantern Bearer guides the other signs, protecting them from danger and monotony.

    **Channel**. When a creature makes a saving throw against becoming blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or stunned, you can use a ***reaction*** to allow a reroll the save.

    **Greater channel**. Aberrations, fey, fiends, and undead cannot physically cross over the boundary of bright light, cast spells across it, or project their abilities across it unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails the saving throw can try again on its next turn. A creature that succeeds and moves across the boundary into the protected area isn’t affected by the boundary while it remains inside.

    **Release**. Creatures of your choice within 30 ft of the star gain temporary hit points equal to your wizard level, lasting up to 10 minutes. While a creature still has any of these temporary hit points remaining, aberrations, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attacks against them.

- ### The Newlyweds
    The Newlyweds are represented as an intertwined couple or scarves that slip away for privacy. They are symbols of devotion and new life.

    **Channel**. Reduce damage dealt to chosen targets by 1.

    **Greater channel**. Targets gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier at the beginning of each of their rounds.

    **Release**. You can stabilize any one creature of your choice with 0 hit points that you can see within 60 ft of the star. If you reach 0 hp while within range, the star is automatically released, stabilizing you.

- ### The Bridge
    The constellation of the Bridge carries the travelers of the Cosmic Caravan over danger and toward new adventure, and symbolizes the separation between the dark of winter and the light of spring.

    **Channel**. When a chosen target hits with a melee attack, the attack deals 1 additional point of radiant damage.

    **Greater channel**. Targets have resistance to necrotic damage

    **Release**. The star is released with a bright light, forcing creatures within 30 ft who can see the star to succeed at a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Affected creatures can attempt another saving throw at the end of each of their rounds

- ### The Daughter
    The Daughter is a light-hearted dancer and the first to cross the Bridge into the warmth and sunshine of spring.

    **Channel**. Chosen targets add your Intelligence modifier to their initiative.

    **Greater channel**. Targets have either advantage or disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws (your choice).

    **Release**. The spell star explodes. Each creature of your choice within 30 ft of the star must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 radiant damage.

- ### The Rider
    The Rider is the guardian of the Cosmic Caravan who watches over his companions mounted on his painted steed. He is seen as either a stern barbarian or a boisterous reveler.

    **Channel**. Chosen targets gain +1 to AC.

    **Greater channel**. When an attacker that you can see hits a target within the star’s light with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to halve the attack's damage.

    **Release**. Creatures of your choice within 30 ft of the star must succeed at a Strength saving throw or be pushed away from the star in a straight line, up to 5 x your Intelligence  modifier feet, at which point they are knocked prone. If they succeed, they are knocked back 5 ft, and do not become prone.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-abjuration">School of Abjuration</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Abjuration Savant
| 2nd | Arcane Ward
| 6th | Projected Ward
| 10th | Improved Abjuration
| 14th | Spell Resistance

</div>

The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.

Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.

### Abjuration Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Arcane Ward
You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Ward
When a creature that you can see within 30 ft takes damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### Improved Abjuration
When you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

### Spell Resistance
You have advantage on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-chronomancer">School of Chronomancy</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Spare Seconds
| 2nd | Quicken Time
| 6th | Split Second
| 10th | Chronostasis
| 14th | Major Paradox

</div>

Not all Wizards study the standard schools of magic, some aspire to control another form of power, time itself. Wizards who study such a power are called Chronomancers. Instead of specializing in any particular school to meet their desired goals, Chronomancers achieve their end through subtle manipulation of the past to steer the future towards accomplishing their goals.

### Spare Seconds
You gain the ability to cram a few more seconds into your day. You have a pool of spare seconds equal to your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can expend a number of spare seconds to give yourself extra time:

|  |  |
|:------------:|:--------|
| **1 second** | Gain advantage on a Dexterity saving throw.
| **2 seconds** | Make a Perception or Investigation check as a ***bonus action*** on your turn.
| **3 seconds** | Take an additional ***reaction*** in response to a different trigger than your regular reaction.
| **6&nbsp;seconds** | Take the Ready action as a ***bonus action*** on your turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the start of your next turn. You regain all expended spare seconds when you finish a long rest.

### Quicken Time
You have advantage on initiative rolls.

In addition, you can use a ***bonus action*** and expend a 1st level or higher spell slot to accelerate your path through time. When you expend the spell slot, and then as a ***bonus action*** on each of your turns, you can take the Dash action. The effect lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, until you dismiss it, or until you lose your concentration.

### Delay Damage
Your ability to manipulate time is so precise you're able to freeze it for a fraction of a second to avoid danger. When you would normally be hit by an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to stop time long enough to get out of harm's way. The attack misses and fails to affect you, and you move to a location within 5 ft. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Chronostasis
You instinctively fluctuate time in response to stress. You add the *haste* and ***slow*** spells to your spellbook if they are not there already.

When you take damage, you may cast either spell as a ***reaction*** without expending a spell slot. When you cast *haste* in this way, the target is yourself, and when you cast *slow* in this way, the spell is centered on you.

You can cast a spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Major Paradox
You have become so adept at manipulating the flow of time, that you've become able to manipulate larger events over a greater expanse of time. These sort of changes could be thing such as deciding to learn one spell instead of another, changing the allocation of an Ability Score Improvement or any number of other changes.

There is always some sort of exchange to compensate. When making this change, the Chronomancer must be exact and thoughtful of the repercussions. These changes may only affect you directly. Any changes to the current timeline from this change, planned or otherwise, is up to the DM.

| 1st | Conjuration Savant
| 2nd | Minor Conjuration
| 6th | Benign Transposition
| 10th | Focused Conjuration
| 14th | Durable Summons

</div>

As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.

### Conjuration Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Minor Conjuration
You can use your ***action*** to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 ft of you. This object can be no larger than 3 ft on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 ft.

The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.

### Benign Transposition
You can use your ***action*** to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.

### Focused Conjuration
While you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.

### Durable Summons
Any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.

| 1st | Divination Savant
| 2nd | Portent
| 6th | Expert Divination
| 10th | The Third Eye
| 14th | Greater Portent

</div>

The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

### Divination Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Portent
Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Expert Divination
Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th level.

### The Third Eye
You can use your ***action*** to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.

 **Darkvision**. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 ft.

 **Ethereal Sight**. You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 ft of you.

 **Greater Comprehension**. You can read any language.

 **See Invisibility**. You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 ft of you that are within line of sight.

### Greater Portent
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Enchantment Savant
| 2nd | Hypnotic Gaze
| 6th | Instinctive Charm
| 10th | Split Enchantment
| 14th | Alter Memories

</div>

As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall som ewhere in between.

### Enchantment Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Hypnotic Gaze
Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an ***action***, choose an adjacent creature. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 ft away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.

Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

### Instinctive Charm
When a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll against you, you can use your ***reaction*** to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.

On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

### Split Enchantment
When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

### Alter Memories
Gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your ***action*** to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

| 1st | Favored Magic
| 2nd | Evocation Savant
| 6th | Potent Cantrip
| 10th | Empowered Evocation
| 14th | Overchannel

</div>

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

### Favored Magic
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to write an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Evocation Savant
Choose one of the following options.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Elemental Spark
    When you cast an evocation spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire, cold, thunder, lightning, or acid damage, you can simultaneously create an elemental spark using a strand of the spell's power.

    Your spark closely orbits your body and its appearance match the spell that it was created from. When you take damage from a creature that you can see, you may spend your ***reaction*** to do one of the following:

    **Feedback**: Deal 1d10 damage to the creature. The damage type equals that of your spark.

    **Deflect**: Reduce the damage you take by 1d6.

    When you take one of these actions, your elemental spark is expended and vanishes. You can only have one active elemental spark at a time, and any active spark expires automatically when you finish a short rest.

    **Greater elemental spark**. Starting at 6th level, your Feedback damage increases from 1d10 to 2d10. In addition, your Deflect reduction increases from 1d6 to 2d6.

- #### Sculpt Spells
    You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

</div>

### Potent Cantrip
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation
You can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

### Overchannel
You can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can choose to deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

| 1st | True Familiar
| 2nd | Creature Mystique
| 6th | Servant’s Form
| 10th | Otherworldly Expression
| 14th | Three of a Kind

</div>

Wizards specializing in in the school of the familiar have learned to channel the mystical nature of their familiars. Leveraging their strong bond with their creature companions these zoomancers gain access to spells that they cannot normally learn. Technically these wizards never do learn these spells they just gain the ability to channel their arcane energy into their familiars to unlock the creature’s mystical abilities.

### True Familiar
You learn the *find familiar* spell. You do not expend a spell slot to cast find familiar, its casting time is reduced to 1 minute and you do not need to use spell components.

### Creature Mystique
Your familiars have their own arcane reserves they can call out to power their own spells. On your familiar’s turn, you can expend its spell slot and cast a spell of that level or lower from your familiar’s spell list. Your familiar uses your spell attack modifier and spells it casts use your spell save DC. If the spell requires concentration you must concentrate on it.

Which spells your familiar can cast depends on its type:

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Celestial
    | Spell level | Spells |
    |:---:|:-------------|
    | 1st | *bless, cure wounds* |
    | 2nd | *enhance ability, magic weapon* |
    | 3rd | *aura of vitality, counterspell* |

- #### Fey
    | Spell level | Spells |
    |:---:|:-------------|
    | 1st | *dissonant whispers, faerie fire* |
    | 2nd | *invisibility, moonbeam* |
    | 3rd | *conjure animals, fly* |

- #### Fiend
    | Spell level | Spells |
    |:---:|:-------------|
    | 1st | *bane, inflict wounds* |
    | 2nd | *darkness, enthrall* |
    | 3rd | *fear, hunger of hadar* |

</div>

Each familiar gains one of its own spell slots that you can use to cast its spells. This spell slot is at your highest spell level, but no higher than 5th level. It regains the use of this spell slot when you take a long rest.

### Servant’s Form
You can take the same form as one of your familiars as if you had cast *polymorph* on yourself but without the need for components. You can still use your creature mystique feature while in this form. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### Otherworldly Expression
As an ***action*** on your familiar’s turn you can invoke the ultimate expression of its mystical nature. The exact power varies based on the type of familiar you use this ability on. You can use this feature again after a long rest.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Celestial**. Until the end of your next turn all allies within 10 ft of your familiar gain advantage on saving throws and resistance to all damage.

- **Fey**. You can teleport each creature within 30 ft of your familiar to any unoccupied space within 30 ft of your familiar. This familiar regains its spell slot if it was expended.

- **Fiend**. All enemy creatures within 10 ft of your familiar must make an Intelligence saving throw. If they fail, they gain vulnerability to all damage types they are not immune to and have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your familiar’s next turn.

</div>

### Three of a Kind
You can have two familiars at any given time changing the normal rules of the *find familiar* spell. Both familiars gain their own spell slot with the Creature Mystique feature.

|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Illusion Savant
| 2nd | Improved Minor Illusion
| 6th | Malleable Illusions
| 10th | Illusory Self
| 14th | Illusory Reality

</div>

You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists, including many gnome wizards, are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

### Illusion Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Improved Minor Illusion
You learn the *minor illusion* cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.

### Malleable Illusions
When you have cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your ***action*** to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.

### Illusory Self
You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your ***reaction*** to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Illusory Reality
You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a ***bonus action*** while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

| 1st | Favored Magic
| 2nd | Necromancy Savant
| 6th | Undead Thralls
| 10th | Inured to Undeath
| 14th | Life and Death

</div>

The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.

Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

### Favored Magic
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Necromancy Savant
Choose one of the options *Grim harvest*, *Horrify* or *Knowledge of life and death*.

<div class="columnsthree">

- #### Grim Harvest
    You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the school of necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

- #### Horrify
    Once per turn when creatures are damaged by a spell of 1st level or higher that you have cast, or when a creature is a target or within the area of effect of a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher you have cast, you may impose the **frightened** condition upon that single creature. They may make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid this affect, and again at the end of each of their turns if affected.

    You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier; additionally, you may expend a spell slot of any level to apply this feature to a valid target. You regain all uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.

- #### Knowledge of Life and Death
    Your study of ancient tomes and cadavers has granted you insight of the mystical forces surrounding life and death. As an ***action***, you touch a creature other than yourself and invigorate its life energy. This creature cannot be a construct. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. If the creature is undead, it gains an additional 2d4 temporary hit points.

    Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you expend a spell slot to cast a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher.

</div>

### Undead Thralls
Choose one of the spells *animate dead* or *summon undead*. Add the chosen spell to your spellbook. When preparing spells, the chosen spell does not count to your total number of chosen spells.

If you chose *animate dead*, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate. You can cast *animate dead* as an ***action*** in place of its 1-minute casting time a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, whenever you create an undead using a spell, it has additional benefits:
 * The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
 * The creature adds half your proficiency bonus to its AC and its attack rolls, and adds your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls.
 * The creature is immune to turning effects while  within 100 feet of you.

If you chose *summon undead*, you do not require a material component for that spell. Once when you cast the spell, you may automatically succeed on any concentration check to maintain the spell for its duration. You regain use of this feature upon completion of a long rest. In addition your summoned undead have additional benefits:
 * The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by 10 hp, with an additional 5 hp for each spell level above 3rd.
 * The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls.
 * The creature is immune to turning effects while within 100 feet of you.

### Inured to Undeath
You have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

### Life and Death
Choose one of the options *command undead* or *siphon spirit*.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Command Undead
    You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an ***action***, choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet. That target must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

    Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

- #### Siphon spirit
    You can use your magic to consume life from creatures in your presence. As an ***action***, you can target one creature within 60 ft. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage and you regain up to that number of hit points, or the creature's maximum hit points - whichever is lower.

    Undead you control automatically fail this save, living creatures make this save at advantage, and constructs are immune to this feature. A creature targeted by this ability is immune to it for the next 24 hours.

| 1st | Favored Magic
| 2nd | Knowledge of Life and Death, Sense Undead
| 6th | Undead Scourge
| 10th | Inured to Undeath
| 14th | Undead Purge

</div>

You are a necromancer who has used your knowledge for a far different purpose. Sometimes called a white necromancer, you stand as a guardian between the living and the dead. Often acting as guardians for tombs and burial grounds, your order makes sure the dead stay where they are put. Should they fail to do so, you are ready and willing to deal with them.

### Favored Magic
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Knowledge of Life and Death
Your study of ancient tomes and cadavers has granted you insight of the mystical forces surrounding life and death. As an ***action***, you touch a creature other than yourself and invigorate its life energy. This creature cannot be a construct or undead. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or expend a spell slot to cast a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher.

### Sense Undead
Gain the ability to feel undead around you. This ability works like the spell *detect good and evil* but only works on undead and is always active.

### Undead Scourge
You become more adept at hurting undead. You may sacrifice a spell slot to do radiant damage to one undead you can see within 30 ft. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Wizard spell save DC or suffer 1d6 radiant damage per level of the spell sacrificed.

### Inured to Undeath
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects. Gain resistance to necrotic damage and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. 

### Undead Purge
You can use your ***action*** to create a 30 ft radius aure. Living creatures within it have advantage on all saving throws made against undead spells and abilities. Additionally, undead have disadvantage on all attacks.

As an ***action***, you can choose one undead within the area. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, it takes 4d8 radiant damage and you regain up to that number of hit points, or the creature's maximum hit points - whichever is lower. A creature targeted by this ability is immune to it for the next 24 hours.

#### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Conjuration/Necromancy Savant
| 2nd | Reawaken Soul
| 6th | Volatile Soul
| 10th | Consume
| 14th | Lasting Creation

</div>

As a member of the school of reawakening, you combine the forces of necromancy with the power of conjuration. By transforming the necromantic energies of the creatures you kill into completely new conjurations, you bridge the gap between these two school of magic, creating a hybrid school that combines elements of both Conjuration and Necromancy. As you progress, you learn to shape together ever more powerful conjurations.

### Conjuration/Necromancy Savant
When you select this school, the time you must spend to copy a necromancy or conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Reawaken Soul
Gain the ability to store the essence of a creature's soul for later use. You create a Soul Vial, which can be used to store the soul of a creature that has a CR of less than 1/4 your Wizard level, rounded up. By using a 10 minute ritual on a creature that has died within the last hour, you can store that creature's soul in the vial. If there is already a soul within the vial, then the new soul replaces it.

Once you have a soul contained within your Soul Vial, you can release it to reform that creature. The creature has the same statistics as the creature you gathered the soul from, but it appears slightly translucent and visibly magical. Once formed, the creature lasts for up to 1 hour, and requires your concentration to maintain. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

Once you form a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Volatile Soul
Creatures you create through your Reawaken Soul feature explode in a burst of necrotic essence when reduced to zero hit points. Each creature of your choice within a 10 ft radius of the exploding creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage for every point of that creature's CR. Creatures below CR 1 deal 1d6 necrotic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage.

### Consume
You can consume the soul within your Soul Vial to restore hit points to yourself. As an ***action***, you absorb the contents of the vial, regaining 1d6 hit points for every point of that creature's CR. This feature cannot restore hit points to a creature other than yourself.

### Lasting Creation
Creatures created through your Soul Reawaken feature lasts for up to 8 hours and no longer requires concentration to maintain.

### Features
| Wizard Level | Feature |
|:------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Transmutation Savant
| 2nd | Minor Alchemy
| 6th | Transmuter’s Stone
| 10th | Shapechanger
| 14th | Master Transmuter

</div>

You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.

Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.

### Transmutation Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Minor Alchemy
You can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials.

For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

### Transmuter’s Stone
You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession.

When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
 * Darkvision out to a range of 60 ft.
 * An increase to speed of 10 ft while the creature is unencumbered.
 * Proficiency with Constitution saving throws.
 * Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.

### Shapechanger
Add the *polymorph* spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast *polymorph* without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Master Transmuter
You can use your ***action*** to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.

 **Major Transformation**. You can transmute one nonmagical object, no larger than a 5 ft cube, into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.

 **Panacea**. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.

 **Restore Life**. You cast the *raise dead* spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.

 **Restore Youth**. You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimm of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.

| 1st | Transmutation Savant
| 2nd | Natural Adaptation
| 6th | Favored Shapes, Natural Transmogrification
| 10th | Reflexive Change
| 14th | Infinite Variety

</div>

Perhaps none of the arcane spellcasters mighty powers is as versatile, useful, or spectacular as the ability to change into something else entirely. The School of Transmogrification specializes in just that – altering one’s own body as needed with *polymorph* and other shapechanging transmutations.

### Transmutation Savant
When you select this school, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Natural Adaptation
Add the spell *alter self* to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. After doing so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Favored Shapes
Choose three beasts as your favored shapes. A favored shape is a specific kind of beast whose form you can assume by means of the *polymorph* spell. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration while in one of your favored shapes.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your favored shapes with another beast of your choice. You choose an additional favored shape at 10th, 14th, and 20th level. Your favored shapes chosen or replaced at 17th level and beyond can be any creature, not just beasts.

### Natural Transmogrification
Add the spell *polymorph* to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and only to become one of your favored shapes. Once you cast *polymorph* in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

### Reflexive Change
When attacked or a creature causes you to make a saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to cast *polymorph* (expending a spell slot for a prepared *polymorph* spell or using the Natural Transmogrification feature) targeting yourself and only into one of your favored shapes. Beginning at 17th level, you can instead cast *true polymorph* in this way.

After using this feature, you must finish a long rest before using it again.

### Infinite Variety
Gain the ability to create imaginary forms when casting *polymorph, true polymorph*, and *shapechange* on yourself. To create an imaginary form, choose one of your favored shapes as a base form. You then choose a single aspect of a second monster whose form you can assume with the spell being cast and add it to the first creature. Available options include the following.

 * Replace the base form’s Armor Class with that of the second form.
 * Add the second form’s movement modes (i.e. swim speed, climb speed, burrow speed, fly speed).
 * Add one of the second form’s natural attacks if the base form doesn’t already have that attack.
 * Add one of the second form’s damage resistances, damage immunities, or senses.
 * Add one of the second form’s special qualities, besides Spellcasting or Shapechanger.
 * Replace one of the base form’s physical ability scores, if both forms are of the same size category.

For example, if the base form was a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the second form was a Giant Owl, you could add the fly speed of 60 ft to the Tyrannosaurus Rex, making it a winged T-Rex. If the first form was a Giant Scorpion, and the second a Giant Octopus, you could add the Octopus’s tentacle attack to the Giant Scorpion, grappling enemies from afar, then clawing and stinging them.

</div>

Your studies focus on the primordial might of the winds, harnessing the strength of the sky to aid you. Known as Windbringers, wizards who follow this tradition of sky magic feel most at home near or in the open air, and often study weather patterns, creatures of the air, or the Elemental Plane of Air. Windbringers prefer spells that aid their maneuverability and bring the winds down upon their foes.

### Sky Speaker
When you select this school, you have begun your studies of the sky and air. You learn the  Auran language and the *gust* cantrip. When you cast *gust*, you can cast it as a ***bonus action***, and can affect creatures of size Large or smaller.

### Shielding Air
You can use mighty winds to protect you. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can surround yourself with whirling winds as part of the same action used to cast the spell. Until the beginning of your next turn, ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Gale Mage
You have learned how to infuse your spells with mighty air. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use a ***bonus action*** to channel wind through the spell, choosing one of the following effects:
* If the spell targets one or more hostile creatures, each creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 15 ft by a mighty gust.
* If the spell targets you or an ally, you or your ally’s movement speed increases by 10 ft until the end of their next turn. This increases to 20 ft at 14th level.
* The spell’s range increases by 20 ft.

### Airborne Prodigy
You have become attuned to the strength of the winds. You can cast the *levitate* spell on yourself or a willing creature at will, without expending a spell slot. When you cast *levitate* in this way, you can move the target in any direction of your choice when you use an action to move it.

### Wind Mastery
You have gained mastery over wind. As an ***action***, you can cast the *investiture of wind* spell on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell this way, while the spell is active, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier, to also gain a flying speed of 60 ft. This lasts as long as you maintain concentration and the targets keep within 20 ft from you.

Once you cast *investiture of wind* in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
