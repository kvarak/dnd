# Inquisitor
Most people of the world are familiar with clerics; the healers and preachers who spread the word of the Gods. Most also are familiar with paladins, who uphold virtuous principles and protect the meek. Inquisitors, while undoubtedly devoted to their god, is neither of these. Inquisitors are holy hunters; they seek to strike out into the world and unleash the wrath of their god upon those who defy them.

#### Answers only to their deity
The inquisitor is in many ways similar to the paladin, but where the paladin serves his cause by being a shining example for others, the inquisitor work in the shadows, doing the dirty work that is necessary. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals. An inquisitor is not always the follower that the church wants, but the follower that the church needs.

Each inquisitor has different goals, largely based on their god and their god's desires. An inquisitor of Pelor, for example, may seek out and destroy undead, while and inquisitor of Silvanus may hunt those who would harm or destroy nature. All inquisitors have a divine mission.

If you detect the creature in this manner after 24 hours have elapsed, you may attempt to renew the brand. The creature becomes acutely aware of your intent to rebrand it, and makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success, the brand remains until its time has elapsed, but you cannot make another attempt to brand it remotely. On a failure, the creature takes 1 fire damage and is branded for an additional 48 hours, and may be branded in this manner again after 24 hours.
