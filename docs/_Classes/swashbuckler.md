# Swashbuckler
Heavy warriors are your classic plate-bound tank warriors who are most at home on large battlefields or delving deep within some old dungeon. They favor brute force and stamina to carry them through challenges.

Swashbucklers on the other hand prefer to rely on their quickness, agility, finesse, daring and wit. They are most often found in campaigns that focus on urban adventuring, where heavily armored knights are often banned on the streets. They also dominate in campaigns with a more renaissance focus to the fantasy genre, as well of course as in any campaign based on the high seas, where a heavy fighter becomes a high liability.

<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Short rest |
|:-|
| After a short rest: |
| * Regain use of ***Reactive***.

| Long rest |

| After a long rest: |
| * Regain half your maximum ***Panache*** (rounded up).

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Panache
More than just a lightly armored warrior, a swashbuckler is a daring combatant. He fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler's ability to perform amazing actions.

The maximum number of panache you can have at any time is equal to your proficiency bonus. *See Rest Additions for when you regain panache.*

A swashbuckler spends panache to use many of his maneuvers and regains one panache whenever one of the following occurs:

* **Critical Hit** with an unarmed attack, a light weapon or finesse weapon.
* **Critical Success** on a movement check during combat.
* **Daring Act**. As a general guideline, a daring act should be risky and dramatic. It should take a good deal of guts, and its outcome should have a low probability of success. Each time you perform a daring act, you regain 1 panache.

#### Tricks and deeds
Panache can be used in combat, to power your <a href="#internal-tricks">Tricks</a>, and for <a href="#internal-deeds">Deeds</a>. You learn additional tricks and deeds at certain levels as shown in the Swashbuckler table. Each time you learn new trick or deed, you can also replace one you know with a different one.

### Reactive
Beginning at 2nd level, you can make one additional reaction. You can still only react once on a single event. *See Rest Additions for more details.*

From 9th level, you can spend a panache to use this feature additional times.

### Supreme Confidence
Your supreme confidence in yourself shows and can't wait to come out.

Starting at 2nd level, you may spend one panache to give yourself advantage on any Charisma ability check or saving throw.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to halve the attack's damage against you.



<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### New Equipment
These two new types of shields are available to anyone, though they are more commonly used by swashbucklers (hence their name).

| Armor| Cost | AC | Weight|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Buckler | 5 gp | +1 | 2 lbs |
| Buckler, strapped | 10 gp | +1 | 3 lbs |

 **Buckler**. A small metal shield held in a fist grip (not strapped). You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

 **Buckler, strapped**. A buckler strapped to the forearm, allowing the hand to hold an item. As it must be strapped, it takes 2 round to don and doff. You gain the buckler's AC bonus only if you choose to have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons held in that hand.

</div>

### Charmed Life
At 9th level, the swashbuckler gains a knack for getting out of trouble.

As a ***reaction***, gain advantage on a saving throw and regain one panache point. If the save fails, you may use this ability again, otherwise you can't use it until you finish a long rest.

### Riposte
Starting at 11th level, when a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to make a melee weapon attack against the creature.

At 14th level, if you hit and only wield one weapon, you do an additional die of damage with that attack.

### Elusive
At 20th level, you are so elusive that attackers rarely get the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.


<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

#### Multiclassing
Should you wish to multiclass into a swashbuckler, the prerequisites and proficiencies gained are listed below.

- ***Ability Score Minimum***: Dexterity 13 and Charisma or Intelligence 13
- ***Proficiencies Gained***: Light armor, buckler shield, rapier, shortsword

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-blacksnake">Blacksnake</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Blacksnake features
| Swashbuckler level | Feature |
|:------------------:|:--------|
| 1st  | Prehensile whip |
| 3rd  | Whip Specialization |
| 7th  | Lifeline |
| 10th | Modified Whip |
| 15th | Flay |
| 18th | Demoralizing Lash |

</div>

Blacksnakes are masters of the whip, focusing on the possibilities inherent in using a length of leather or cord to accomplish things less flexible weapons can't.

Blacksnakes are most common among the lower castes and are usually found working as enforcers, assassins, thief-takers or thieves. In many cases, they operate in regions where carrying a greatsword or pike would draw attention, but little thought is given to someone with a rope belt or loop of tanned hide hanging from her belt.

Of course, it takes more than a need for stealth to drive someone to train in the ways of the whip - daggers and saps can be concealed and mastered far more easily than going through the training required to become a blacksnake. Only a natural talent for the knacks required, and a fascination with the movement of a whip, can drive someone to put in the months of training it takes to go from mere proficiency with a whip to having the blacksnake's ability to make her lash dance so precisely.

Blacksnakes are often perceived as thugs and bullies, and the archetype package is often taken by characters that are slavers and enforcers. But some adventurers and tomb delvers also favor the flexibility and reach of the whip, and have more interest in it as a tool than an instrument of cruelty. Of course, the difference between these two types of blacksnakes is solely in their attitudes, and so can be difficult to determine at a glance. Many good-hearted adventurers who become blacksnakes will find locals are mistrustful of anyone carrying a long braid of steel-tipped leather.


<img src='http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/218754/Master_Scourge.png' style='float:left;width:30%;padding:20px' />

### Prehensile whip
In your hand a whip has a life of its own, wrapping around pillars and items with ease. When becoming a blacksnake, you can perform the following:

* You can use a whip as if it were a rope with a grappling hook at the end.
* As a an ***item action***, you can use your whip to manipulate an unattended object up to 15 feet away as if you were adjacent to it. For example, you can pick the object up, bringing it to you.
* You can use your whip as a swing line, allowing you to cross chasms and rapidly climb the length of the whip. As an ***action***, you can lash the end of your whip to any appropriate anchor point within range. As part of a ***move action***, you can then move up to 25 feet across or 15 feet up from your starting point without requiring Acrobatics or Athletics checks that might normally be needed, moving at full speed even up a wall, over a chasm, or across difficult terrain.

### Whip Specialization
At 3rd level, the base damage you deal with a whip is increased by one die size (i.e. to 1d6 for a normal whip) and you may add an additional 5 feet to the reach of your whip.

When you hit with an attack using your whip, if the target your size or smaller, you may use your ***bonus action*** to pull the target 5 feet towards you or to knock it prone. The target must succeed at a Strength or Dexterity check to avoid being moved or knocked prone. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

When you are wielding a whip, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.

### Lifeline
From level 7, when you or a nearby creature is falling, you can use the whip as a ***reaction***. If you are the one falling, make an attack roll against a AC of 10, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around.

When attempting this check on another creature, make an attack roll against that target to catch it. If the weight of the creature exceeds your carrying capacity, you are pulled after it.

### Modified Whip
At 10th level, you learn how to modify your whip to become even more deadly. By spending a short rest and materials worth 10 gp, you can modify a whip with a metal tip and attached razor blades. This increases the damage type of the whip by one step (i.e. base damage to 1d6, or to a 1d8 for you).

When taking the attack action, and using you own modified whip, you can attack an additional target if it is adjacent to any of your other targets.

### Improvised Whip
If you are ever without you whip, you can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet long. Length in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side. This damage die for this improvised whip is reduced by one size (i.e. 1d4 with your whip specialization). You can also use a knotted rope this way, dealing bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage.



### Flay
From 15th level you can actually lift skin off your targets with well-struck attacks using your whip. By spending 1 panache when you hit with an attack, you deal 1d8 additional slashing damage. If the target fails a Constitution save against 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency modifier, the pain distracts the target, causing it to have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability check until the start of your next turn. If the target succeeds at its save, you regain 1 panache.

### Demoralizing Lash
You cow your enemies with the lash of a whip. At 18th level, when you hit a target, you can spend 1 panache to force the target to make a Wisdom save against 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency modifier. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns. As long as you are in attack range with your whip, that save is made at a disadvantage.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-brawler">Brawler</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Brawler features
| Swashbuckler level | Feature |
|:------------------:|:--------|
| 1st  | Pugilist |
| 3rd  | Brawny tavern fighter |
| 7th  | Counterstrike, Enhanced attack |
| 10th | Dirty Fighting |
| 15th | Sucker Punch |
| 18th | Taking a Beating |

</div>

Brawlers are an up-close, in-your-face, grim-and-gritty combatant. A master of unarmed hand-to-hand combat, ready to throw down at any time, they are the typical street thug. They are not monks with their codes and mysticism. They don't learn their prowess through discipline and intense teaching but through survival of the fittest.

### Pugilist
When you choose this archetype, your experience with brawling has given you a mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and fist weapons, giving you the following benefits.

* You are proficient with improvised weapons and unarmed fighting, including checks to attack, shove, grapple and escape a grapple.
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed and fist weapon attacks.
* You can roll d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or fist weapon. This die increases to d6 at 8th level and d8 at 16th level.
* When you use the Attack action, you can attempt a grapple or make one additional unarmed strike as a ***bonus action***.



### Brawny Tavern Fighter
From 3rd level, improvised weapons are considered one size level less. For example, heavy improvised weapons are considered as normal for you. Large items like tables are just heavy, etc.

You can spend one panache to increase the damage die of an improvised weapon for one round. Whenever you use two different improvised weapons in two consecutive rounds, you regain one panache.

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/zsJPmQk.png' style='float:right;width:25%;padding:20px' />

### Counterstrike
At 7th level, when you take damage from a creature within reach, you can use your ***reaction*** to make an unarmed attack against that creature. If you are wielding an improvised weapon, you can use that instead, striking so hard that it breaks. It deals twice the damage dice, but cannot be used any longer.

### Enhanced Attack
Additionally at 7th level your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Dirty Fighting
At 10th level, you can use your unpredictable fighting style to make vicious attacks against your foe. Whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend a panache to impose one of the following effects on the target:

* It must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* It must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
* It must make a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

### Sucker Punch
At 15th level, you learn how to place your unarmed attacks for the maximum impact. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature unarmed or with an improvised weapon, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target, or 1d12 if you spend one panache.

### Taking a Beating
At 18th level, you can take an impressive amount of beating. You gain resistance to nonmagical damage.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-corsair">Corsair</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Corsair features
| Swashbuckler level | Feature |
|:------------------:|:--------|
| 1st  | Scallywag tricks |
| 3rd  | Fearsome Presence |
| 7th  | Bonus Deed |
| 10th | Fearsome reputation |
| 15th | Ruthless Command |
| 18th | Anything Might Be a Trap |

</div>

While it doesn't take much more than a ship and a crew to become a pirate, corsairs are a finer breed of freebooter. A corsair's debonair charm and style make her a paradoxical celebrity even among the nations whose ships she plunders.

Corsairs can be evil or good depending on their motivations and methods. Behind these motivations, most corsairs have a formative moment that led them to a life at sea. Consider with your DM what this moment could be, or roll on the Life at Sea table, below:

##### Life at Sea
| d10 | My story |
|:---:|:---------|
| 1 | I seek to build wealth and reknown to eventually become worthy of my true love. |
| 2 | When I was young, pirates raided a vessel I was on and took me for their crew. |
| 3 | I quest after rumors of a famed pirate's legendary hidden treasure. |
| 4 | I took to the sea to escape my criminal history, only to have it follow me there. |
| 5 | I partake of piracy to restore my family's once-great riches, and thus their nobility. |
| 6 | I was betrayed by my kingdom, and became a pirate to find revenge. |
| 7 | My birth culture was too constrained, I took to the seas seeking freedom. |
| 8 | I seek a lost family member, and piracy finances my journey. |
| 9 | The bastard of a wealthy family, my only choice was to make my own name at sea. |
| 0 | Roll again twice, both are true. |

<img src='http://pfseconddarkness.wdfiles.com/local--files/mister-plugg/Mister%20Plugg.png' style='float:left;width:30%;padding:20px' />

### Scallywag tricks
As a corsair, you have a better understanding of how to move about and survive at sea, from climbing through riggings to swimming through waves. While you are either wearing light armor or no armor and not holding a shield, you gain both a swimming and a climbing speed equal to your normal movement speed. You can also hold your breath for twice as long.

Additionally, you gain proficiency as sailor and one of the following: carpenter's tools, cartographer's tools, cook's utensils, navigator's tools or woodcarver's tools.



### Fearsome Presence
You don't become a pirate by being nice. At 3rd level, your confident swagger unnerves your foes. You gain proficiency with intimidation. You may choose to use either Charisma or Intelligence when making such checks.

You can use an ***action*** to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose a creature within 30 feet. If the creature can see, hear and understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

On subsequent turns, you can use your ***bonus action*** to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature one additional turn. The target is allowed a save to avoid this. This effect ends if the creature cannot see you or moves more than 60 feet away from you. If the creature succeeds at its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

If you cause an opponent to flee due to your presence, you regain one panache.

At 10th level, your swagger gives an additional benefit when using **Charmed Life**. If you succeed at a saving throw against an opponent's attack or ability while using **Charmed Life** on that save, you can use fearsome presence to demoralize that opponent without using an action.

### Bonus Deed
At 7th level you gain a bonus deed. The following deeds are added to the list of deeds that you are able to choose:

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Eyes of the Storm**. Whenever you have at least one panache, you can see three times as far as normal in both magical and non-magical fog, also granting advantage when using stealth in these conditions. In addition you have advantage on checks that are penalized due to weather conditions (basically removing the disadvantage).

- **Parrot Familiar**. You gain a parrot as an animal companion. It functions as the *find familiar* spell, although it can't be stored in a pocket dimension. If it dies, another takes its place the next day. It has Improved Evasion when sharing your space.

- **Stylish Hat**. Some pirates wear stylish hats. While you have at least one panache, you gain a +1 bonus to all Charisma skill checks. You may spend one panache to throw the hat as ***bonus action***. Each creature within 30 ft paying attention to you (and your hat) must make a Wisdom save against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier or become distracted for a moment. Until the start of their next turn, they are incapacitated.

</div>

### Fearsome reputation
Starting at 10th level, you have crafted a fierce reputation that precedes you and smoothes your way. When you make it known who you are, you may immediately make an intimidation check against everyone within 60 ft who can hear, see and understand you. A person can only be targeted once per day by this.

In addition, once per long rest in a settlement, you may call upon one of these boons:

* Gain free room and board, as well as free stowing of a vehicle (stabling of a pack animal, mooring a ship, etc.).
* Convince common thugs or bandits to back down from a fight.
* Convince local authorities to look the other way or grant you leniency regarding a minor infraction, like forgetting to peacebond your weapon, breaking curfew, or cracking some skulls at the tavern.



### Ruthless Command
At level 15 even your allies respect your presence and know you are not to be trifled with. You can spend a ***reaction*** or ***bonus action*** to remove the frightened condition from an ally within hearing range. As long as you have at least one panache, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

### Anything Might Be a Trap
When you reach 18th level, you have become adept at detecting ambushes and quickly escaping danger. By spending one panache, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

|:-|
| After a Long rest: |
| * Regain all uses of ***Insulting Banter***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

The daredevil relies on speed, agility and panache. They are considered brave by some and foolish by others, as they often throw themselves into battle where it is as thickest.

Daredevils dart in and out of the fray,  wearing  down opponent after opponent with lunges and feints, all while foiling the powerful attacks against them with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their deft parries and fatal ripostes are carnage elevated to an art form. Some may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but behind this veneer lie people deeply dedicated to their craft.


### Never trapped
You proficient with more unconventional ways of movement, such as jumping off chandeliers, sliding across tables and throwing yourself from 3rd story windows, just to land on a store marquee.

### "Five of them, hardly seems fair..."
When you are in melee combat with more than one creature, you know how to move so that the opponents distract each other. Starting at 3rd level, you alway gain a bonus to AC equal to the number of opponents in melee with you -2. If you are facing three or more opponents simultaneously and choose the Dodge action, you can use a ***reaction*** after the third attack against you to make a melee attack. When doing this you regain one panache.

### One Against Many
At 7th level, when 2 or more enemies are adjacent to you, you may adopt a fighting strategy which uses your opponents against each other. When an enemy misses you with an attack (melee or ranged), you may use your reaction to redirect their attack against one of the enemies adjacent to you. They must re-roll their attack against the enemy you choose.

### Insulting Banter
At 10th level, you can use your wit and skill to toss a constant stream of irritating witty banter to distract, confuse and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your ***reaction*** to roll a 1d8 and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this ability after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.

If you are surrounded by 3 or more opponents, you can spend one panache to affect all opponents within reach instead. If you do, they additionally reduce their dice rolls by 1d4, as the *bane* spell, until the start of your round.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You regain any all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Whirlwind Strike
At 15th level, you can use your ***action*** to make a melee attack against any number of adjacent creatures, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### With Daring and Panache
A daredevil really enjoys being in the center of a battle and this really shows at 18th level. When you start your turn surrounded by 3 or more opponents, you regain hit points equal to 5 + number of opponents. You don't gain this benefit if you have more than half your hit points left or at 0 hit points.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-duelist">Duelist</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Duelist features
| Swashbuckler level | Feature |
|:------------------:|:--------|
| 1st  | Practice Makes Perfect |
| 3rd  | Challenge |
| 7th  | Precise Strike |
| 10th | Famed Blade |
| 15th | Critical precision |
| 18th | No Cheating |

</div>

Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying  blows and countering attacks  with swift thrusts of their blades. They may wear armor, but generally eschew such bulky protection as their grace allows them to dodge their opponents with ease. While others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.

Many duelists travel from place to place seeking fortune, fame, and new opponents to test their skills against. Most live on the open road fighting for a share of prize purses, or even championing a cause, while others fight as pure mercenaries or even fight duels to humiliate or even slay foes in a "legal" death matches. Some duelists who relish in the idea of working with companions instead of a solo artist, are drawn to the life of the adventurer as an ever ongoing source of entertainment to keep them honed in their skills,  not to mention for the wealth and notoriety.



<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/3e/b3/ed3eb3f6c3f82fdfdc0e346468b241b5.png' style='float:left;width:25%;padding:20px' />

### Practice Makes Perfect
A duelist's skills comes from years of practice. When choosing this archetype, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose any one of the options presented in the fighter description. You cannot take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you gain a level in a class that has the Fighting Style feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to your class.

### Challenge
A duelist "knows" that he is a better fencer than most and relishes in testing their skills against worthy opponents. At 3rd level, as an ***action***, you can issue a challenge to a target who can see, hear and understand you. If that target attacks you and you are the only one involved in combat with him, you get one panache at the start of your next turn.

### Precise Strike
Starting at 7th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, you can spend 1 panache to increase the extra damage to 2d6.

### Famed Blade
Starting at 10th level, folks know of you and thus not to trifle with you, owing to a well-deserved reputation. Think of what your reputation is and how you earned it. In addition, once per long rest in a settlement, you may call upon one of these boons:

* Gain free room and board, as well as free stabling of a pack animal.
* Convince common thugs or bandits to back down from a fight.
* Convince local authorities to look the other way regarding a minor infraction, like forgetting to peacebond your weapon, breaking curfew, or cracking some skulls at the tavern.

### Critical precision
At 15th level, attacks with light or finesse weapons score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

### No Cheating
At 18th level, when you are in single combat with an enemy, as a ***reaction*** you can get advantage on saving throws against spells you are aware of, until the start of your next round. Unfortunately, so does your opponent until the start of his next turn. You can spend one panache to only affect yourself.

</div>

Fatebenders find themselves on the edges of fate, dancing along the far extremes of probability and causality. They cannot do the impossible, but often the extremely improbable happens around them, always to their benefit. Fatebender aren’t necessarily particularly good at anything. It's just that the universe likes to help them out. Many people blessed or cursed in this way fail to understand the meaning of it all, believing themselves to just be unnaturally lucky or that those around them are horribly misfortunate.

Life is often easy for fatebenders, as good fortune naturally falls into their laps. Casually confident and self-sure, they are flamboyant and reckless champions of destiny—in hopeless battles the good fortune radiating from a fatebender can inadvertently turn the tide in their favor.

### Luck Beats Skill
hen you choose this archetype, you’ve learned to trust in fate more than your own fighting prowess. You gain proficiency with improvised weapons. You may add your Luck modifier to attack and damage rolls with improvised weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed strikes instead of any other ability modifier.

In addition, your seemingly critical injuries often result merely with weapons imbedded into holy books, canteens, and other innocuous objects that just happen to be in the right pocket to buffer attacks. Whenever you would take bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, you can spend 1 panache and reduce the damage by up to 1d6 + your swashbuckler level.

### Panache
You may select one of the following ways to regain panache:

- **Nourishing Misfortune**. You discover that you feel uplifted and more connected to the tapestry of fate when others around you suffer from terrible luck. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you rolls a d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that results in a natural 1, you regain 1 panache.

- **Favored Fortunes**. You feel uplifted by the tapestry of fate whenever good fortunes are found around you. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you rolls a d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that results in a natural 20, you regain 1 panache.

### Bend Fate
From 3rd level, you can tactfully tug upon a strand of fate to shift the circumstances in your favor. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 30 feet of you (including yourself), you can use your ***reaction*** and spend 1 panache to force that creature to reroll the d20 after the result of the roll is known but before the outcome is determined. You may not reroll an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that has already been rerolled.

### Chaos Theory
Also at 3rd level, your presence distorts the tapestry of fate, causing the highly unlikely but not technically impossible to happen. You can spend 2 panache to choose one highly unlikely event to occur within 50 feet of you. The exact nature of this event is left up to the GM’s discretion but is otherwise limited to any event that could conceivably happen, however unlikely, but nothing that requires supernatural actions to occur. Examples include a cat conveniently distracting the guards, the barman’s cask of ale suddenly breaking, or drawing a hand of winning cards.

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

##### I Admit It’s Kinda Eerie
The Chaos Theory feature can be powerful but how it functions is largely left up to the GM’s discretion and allows players direct access to the fickle hand of fate. Don’t feel beholden to it—this feature is meant to represent chaos after all. Allow this feature to be used creatively, but remind fatebenders that chaos can just as easily backfire as work in the party’s favor. Remember that nothing supernatural is meant to occur, just highly unlikely but otherwise mundane events, and nothing should occur that has more impact than a cantrip.

</div>

### Chance Encounter
At 7th level, fate rarely lets you miss a destined encounter or clue, causing you to figuratively and often literally trip over what you are seeking.

Whenever you or an ally within 60 feet makes any type of check to locate a creature or object, you may add your Luck modifier to the check.

### Dumb Luck
Fate tries to buffer you from harmful circumstances.

From 10th level, whenever you trigger a trap, as a ***reaction*** you may spend 2 panache. If you do, a mechanism of the trap fails and it does not activate. As a ***reaction*** when you fail a saving throw or contested ability check, you can spend 3 panache to succeed instead.

In addition, when you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

### Deus Ex Machina
At 15th level, you and your friends have lived through impossibly dangerous experiences and come out the other side smiling, surviving deathly circumstances in the unlikeliest of ways. Once, as a ***reaction*** when an effect forces you or any creatures within 30 feet of you to make saving throws, you may choose a number of creatures up to your Luck modifier. You and the creatures you chose automatically succeed on the saving throw.

### Oblivious and Unscathed
At 18th level, through a nearly impossible comedy of errors, you can stride through a battlefield of carnage and danger to emerge intact. You can use this feature as an ***action*** and when you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, any attacks that target you automatically miss and you cannot be the target of spells or abilities.

| 3rd  | Roadster's Maneuvers |
| 7th  | Highway Mount |
| 10th | Elusive |
| 15th | Honor Among Allies |
| 18th | Cheat Death |

</div>

The thieves and brigands who prey on travelers are known as highwaymen - whether or not they're actually men. Many merchants and nobles may fear highwaymen, recounting stories of them and taking precautions against falling victim to the outlaw's blade. The poor on the other hand speak of highwaymen with reverence, occasionally calling them "the knights of the road".


### Distant Traveler

When you select this archetype, you gain proficiency with medium armor, land vehicles, and with handle animals. In addition, while traveling on a mount or using a land vehicle that you control, you and that mount or vehicle can travel twice the distance in the same amount of time with no penalty for exhaustion.



<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c0/2d/aa/c02daacd30c02d1cd434be41c0537cfa.png' style='float:left;width:20%;padding:20px' />

### Roadster's Maneuvers
At 3rd level you learn the maneuvers of the traveling bandits and highway brigands. You gain a bonus deed. The following deeds are added to the list of deeds that you are able to choose.

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Gallows Humor**. During a short rest you may spend a panache to perk up your allies. If you do, you and any friendly creatures that can hear and understand you, also heals hp equal to your Charisma modifier for each hit die used.

- **Facade**. You have crafted a facade, an alternate persona. This facade can look however you like, but it is suggested they have a memorable and ostentatious name and appearance, or an otherwise eccentric feature (such as a mask or cape). You can adopt or discard your facade as an action. While adopted, you have advantage on any checks made to hide your true identity, and other creatures have disadvantage on any checks made to identify you and your facade as the same person.

- **Point Blank Shot**. When you make a ranged attack while adjacent to a hostile creature, you may expend a panache to negate the disadvantage for attacking at close range.

</div>


### Highway Mount
At 7th level, you have become a great threat while riding a mount. While mounted you have advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls against unmounted creatures smaller than your mount. In addition, through random happenstance, from a commoner you aided, by stealing it, or some other method, you have obtained a reasonable, quality mount for the area your party is traveling in. Consult with your DM on the best way for you to have obtained your mount, and what kind of mount you have been able to obtain.

### Elusive
At 10th level you know that your reputation precedes you, which isn't always a good thing. You know you must remain ever vigilant and gain advantage on check made to detect danger. In addition, when a creature you can see has advantage on an attack roll against you, you may spend a panache to negate that advantage.

### Honor Among Allies
At 15th level you have attuned your senses not only to danger at your heels, but encroaching upon your allies. Any adjacent ally that you can see cannot have an AC lower than yours.

### Cheat Death
From 18th level, you are adept at escaping the cold grasp of death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 2 panache to have 1 hit point instead, even if the attack would otherwise kill you.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-musketeer">Musketeer</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Musketeer features
| Swashbuckler level | Feature |
|:------------------:|:--------|
| 3rd  | Courtly Graces, "Musketeers, United We Stand" |
| 3rd  | Musketeer Tricks |
| 7th  | Combat Superiority |
| 10th | Side By Side |
| 15th | One for All |
| 18th | And All For One |

</div>

While many Swashbucklers strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. Many of these dedicated swashbucklers are known as musketeers. These musketeers swear themselves to a purpose or a monarch, serving it above all else. They are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their purpose trailing on a long, fluttering banner. Their true power comes from the conviction of their ideals, the oaths that they swear, and the challenges they make.


### Courtly Graces
A musketeer is usually well aware of how to address people at all levels within an organisation, be it the court, a military camp or a merchant guild. When you choose this archetype, you can spend one panache to reroll a failed Charisma check when in such a situation.

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/af/e2/b7afe2829566dc7e809f61ce86f1c3f2.png' style='float:right;width:35%;padding:20px' />


### Musketeers, United We Stand
Also from 1st level, when you first encounter a military encampment, fortification, or military unit, you can take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

* What is the name of the unit, what is its banner, and who is its commander?
* About how many soldiers are there, and what is their overall strength, morale, and fighting readiness?
* Are there any holes in their defense or weak points in their logistics I might exploit?

Additionally, whether or not you still serve in the military, at one time you did and you still possess contacts with a military organization. When you can get in touch with your contacts they can help you with one of the following:

* Gain an audience with a military leader.
* Requisition military equipment not normally available to adventurers, though there will likely be a cost and conditions to its use. Examples of such equipment might include alchemists fire, a trebuchet, a battering ram, military caltrops, or other gear depending on the campaign setting.
* Request a map of a territory patrolled by the military organization and safer passage through that territory.



### Musketeer tricks
At 3rd level you gain a bonus trick. The following exclusive trick is added to the list of tricks that you are able to choose.

<div class="columnstwo">

- **Commanding Gesture**. As a ***bonus action*** you may expend 1 panache to give a silent command to an ally within 30 ft who can see you. The chosen ally may immediately use a reaction to take one action, adding your Intelligence modifier to any attack roll or ability check they make.

</div>

### Combat Superiority
At 7th level you gain superiority as a fighter 5 levels lower.

### Side By Side
Musketeers are used to working in group and know that their success depends on all working together. At 10th level, you can use you ***reaction*** to grant an adjacent ally advantage on one attack against an adjacent target.

### One for All
When you reach 15th level you have learned how best to benefit from those who fight by your side. When adjacent to an ally, you may add a d4 to your attack and damage rolls. In addition, when you perform the Help action in combat and your ally succeeds on the aided check, you may flip a coin. On a result of heads, you regain 1 panache.

### And All For One
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
