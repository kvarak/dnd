# Warlock
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity - beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.

Warlocks don’t seek a trust pact with a patron intrigued by their personality, for they know that ultimately every patron, even the most benevolent ones, have their own interests at core and treat their mortal servants as mere, disposable pawns. A warlock applies to the signing and clauses of their pact the same rigorous method that wizards apply to the study of arcane magic; for, as most warlocks believe, it is ultimately possible for a warlock to outsmart its own patron. And, as mortal warlocks study their schemes, all their patrons laugh.

Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.

Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock’s entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god’s ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.

The sections that follow provide ways to embellish a warlock character that could generate some intriguing story and roleplaying opportunities.

#### Patron’s Attitude
Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it’s not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.

When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how things look from the patron’s perspective. Is your patron an ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?

#### Patron Attitudes
| d6 | Attitude |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | Your patron has guided and helped your family for generations and is kind toward you. |
| 2 | Each interaction with your capricious patron is a surprise, whether pleasant or painful. |
| 3 | Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead being who sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influence the world. |
| 4 | Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you with a measure of respect. |
| 5 | Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you as a slave.
| 6 | You are mostly left to your own devices with no interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the demands it will make when it does appear. |

#### Class Training
Why did you choose the path of a warlock. In the following table are some suggestions, but keep in mind your background and all the other details you have established so far.

#### Warlock Background
| d12 | I became a warlock because … |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | While wandering around in a forbidden place, I encountered an otherworldly being that offered to enter into a pact with me. |
| 2 | I was examining a strange tome I found in an abandoned library when the entity that would become my patron suddenly appeared before me. |
| 3 | I stumbled into the clutches of my patron after I accidentally stepped through a magical doorway. |
| 4 | One of my ancestors had a pact with my patron, so that entity was determined to bind me to the same agreement. |
| 5 | My future patron visited me in my dreams and offered great power in exchange for my service. |
| 6 | **Desperation**. I lived an ordinary life until one day catastrophe struck and I called out desperately to any power that would come to my aid. The entity that gave me this power might be benevolent or sinister in nature, but ever since I called it, the being remains close to me. |
| 7 | **Apprenticed**. My development was guided by a close agent of my patron. It might have been a mortal or magical creature, such as a demon, hag, dryad, elf, or pixie. It has been with me most of my life, instructing me in the arts of spellcasting, charms, and hexes. |
| 8 | **Forbidden lore**. In my youth, there was something I fervently desired, perhaps love, wealth, or revenge. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't obtain that which I coveted. Only when I turned my eye to ancient tomes and ruins and experimented with strange powers beyond my comprehension wes I able to get what I wanted. |
| 9 | **Found familiar**. When I were young, I happened upon a strange animal with whom I forged an instant bond. It instructed me in casting spells and became my closest, most trusted companion. This animal is later revealed to have connection to my patron, perhaps even is my patron in disguise. |
| 10 | **Initiated**. When I came of age, a coven of warlocks initiated me into their circle because I showed great promise. After my initiation ritual, I changed on a fundamental level. |
| 11 | **Invocation**. When I reached adolescence, I wanted power and I wanted it immediately. I didn't have the patience or tolerance to endure endless years of boring theory and formal magical training, so I offered up my body and soul in an invocation to an entity that would grant my desire. |
| 12 | **Possessed**. For reasons I may never understand, an otherworldly entity took possession of me in my formative years. Since then, my mortal body has been the vessel for this mysterious power. |

## Warlock Class Features

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

Edgar opened the thick, black tome with trembling hands, cursing his own frailty - the sickness had come on suddenly, and his days were fast running out.

But after months of sacrifice and careful study - of people telling him he was mad - he finally understood. Edgar looked at the eldritch runes, written in blood. He knew the translations. Shaking, he spoke the words...

#### Pact Boon
To mark the initiation of your pact bargain, you are rewarded with a boon from your patron—an eldritch weapon, a book of forbidden secrets, a trinket that summons a bound familiar, a wand of destructive power, etc. You may choose a boon from the <a href="#internal-boon">list of Pact Boons</a>.

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from your spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock cantrips you know and replace it with another cantrip from your spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from your spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from your spell list, which also must be no higher than your maximum Slot Level.

#### Spellcasting Ability
A warlock rarely stumbles into power by accident—they seek it out, against all wisdom and at great personal cost. With intellect, warlocks decipher eldritch runes, pierce the mortal veil, and bargain with otherworldly powers. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells.

 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You use an arcane focus or your pact boon item as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Eldritch Versatility
When you finish a long rest, you may replace one of your known warlock spells with another spell from your spell list. The new spell must be of the same spell level as the spell you replace.

### Eldritch Invocations
In your study of occult lore, you unearth <a href="#internal-invocations">eldritch invocations</a>, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two <a href="#internal-invocations">eldritch invocations</a> of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Warlock table.

#### Replacing Invocations
When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

#### Patron Invocations
You have access to unique invocations from your Otherworldly Patron, as well as from you Pact boon. Add these to your list of Eldritch Invocation options

### Sacrificial Bargain
At 1st-level, you gain the Sacrificial Bargain feature. With a sacrifice of health, your patron grants you power.

When you cast a warlock spell of 1st-level or higher, you may spend a number of hit die equal to your warlock spell level to cast the spell without expending a spell slot. If the spell can't be cast at a higher level, you may instead spend a number of hit die equal to the spell's maximum casting level.

Once you have used this feature, you can not use it until you have completed a short rest.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

Edgar cut his palm with the black knife, feeding his blood to the ever-hungry pact blade. His patron was pleased with the sacrifice—there would be a reward...

</div>

### Mystic Arcanum
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from your spell list as this arcanum. You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot. You can regain this feature after a long rest.

At higher levels, you gain more spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.

### Eldritch Master
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.

Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.








<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-OtherworldlyPatrons">Otherworldly Patrons</a></h2>

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence - not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

Some of the patrons are described very generally, but that only means that the powers granted are very similar between the being of that type. You have still set up your contract with one  specific being. If you need inspiration for a patron, or roll one randomly, there is a list <a href="../Resources/warlockpatrons.html">HERE</a>.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Other Fiends
    **<a href="#internal-fiend">The Fiend</a>**. You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.


- #### The Natural World
    **<a href="#internal-ancientDragon">The Ancient Dragon</a>**. For reasons unknown to you, an ancient dragon has granted you power.

    **<a href="#internal-ancientToad">The Ancient Toad</a>**. You’ve made a pact with a being of immense size and strength. Sitting in a large, palatial temple within a network of mystical swamps, woods, and rivers lies the Ancient Toad, a creature of knowledge, magic, and power.

    **<a href="#internal-archfey">The Archfey</a>**. Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

    **<a href="#internal-blackthornGrove">The Blackthorn Grove</a>**. You’ve torn out your heart as an offering to the Blackthorn Grove after braving the Maze of Blood and resisting the temptations of the Fields of Acedia. The lifeblood of the world itself runs through your veins, granting you power and passion alike to fulfill your purpose, whatever that may be.

    **<a href="#internal-crone">The Crone</a>**. Your patron is a elder evil force in the world that veers capriciously between its maternal and destructive instincts. Beings of this sort include; Aradia, mother of witchcraft, Baba Yaga, the evil woman, and Hecate, queen of witches.

    **<a href="#internal-hive">The Hive</a>**. Through circumstances desperate or sinister, you have found yourself sworn into the service of the swarms of a hivemind or perhaps an alien entity that presides over them

    **<a href="#internal-keeperDepths">The Keeper of the Depths</a>**. You’ve made a pact with an ancient oceanic entity thet watches over the secrets of the forgotten ages – sunken cities, ships lost at sea, and treasures unimaginable gone to the darkest currents that churn with horrible tentacles and creatures from nightmare.

    **<a href="#internal-monstrosity">The Monstrosity</a>**. You have obtained power from a colossal entity such as the tarrasque, a neothelid, a ha-naga, a behemoth or gargantuan creature (such as a gorilla, reptile, moth or similar), or Dendar the Night Serpent.

    **<a href="#internal-wildHuntsman">Oberon, the Wild Huntsman</a>**. This powerfully-built horned hunter leads the Wyld Hunt, a collection of  fey lords and beasts that rove through the Realms of Faerie and the Mortal Plane seeking bigger and more dangerous game. It is said that he invites the most powerful of his followers to join him on the Wyld Hunt. This same rumor says that he contracts Warlocks primarily to see who is worthy of this honor.

- #### Outer Realms
    **<a href="#internal-ashenWolf">The Ashen Wolf</a>**. A primal spirit of fire and the hunt – a scourge of the forests and fields, and a harbinger of ill fate. This creature is wise and cunning, making deals with those who have the potential to bring ruin and change. Some consider the beast to be native to the Plane of Elemental Fire; others call it a fiend from the darkest hells

    **<a href="#internal-cosmicMachine">The Cosmic Machine</a>**. Your patron is Primus, The One and the Prime, supreme ruler of the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus and overarching will, mind and soul of the Modron race. Primus, its plane and its creations all represent the fundamental concept of universal law: that all is right happens because it must inescapably be, and all that which is wrong must not be.

    **<a href="#internal-eternalCitadel">The Eternal Citadel</a>**. You've made a pact with the Eternal Citadel, a massive yet empty bastion that seems to wander between worlds, collecting travelers to fight for the preservation against the forces that seek destruction.

    **<a href="#internal-fallenExile">The Fallen Exile</a>**. A fallen star, betrayed by its brethren, now seeks to exact revenge against the stars themselves.

    **<a href="#internal-greatOldOne">The Great Old One</a>**. Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings

    **<a href="#internal-shadowCat">The Shadowcat</a>**. Your patron is an otherworldly incarnation of fate that strides between planes; a living omen of ill luck and good fortune alike.

    **<a href="#internal-stormLord">The Storm Lord</a>**. You’ve made a pact with an ancient power known as the Storm Lord. Massive and timeless, this godlike entity sails the winds of the void, finding silent amusement at seeing mortals in peril.

- #### Undead
    **<a href="#internal-emergentMind">The Emergent Mind</a>**. You have noticed — and been noticed by — an unfathomable intelligence that permeates a particular locality. Born from sites of strong emotions, these entities whisper subtly of times forgotten.

    **<a href="#internal-undying">The Undying</a>**. Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of life and undeath.

    **<a href="#internal-vampire">Vampire Lord</a>**. Warlocks who take the Blood Pact, often seek to gain a measure of a master vampire's incredible strength, intimidating presence, and immortal stamina. They desire to become true masters of the night, and eventually, vampires in their own right.

- #### Other Patrons
    **<a href="#internal-death">Death</a>**. Your patron is death itself.

    **<a href="#internal-pharaoh">The Pharaoh</a>**. Your pact is with an ancient king of the desert, more god than mortal.

    **<a href="#internal-seducer">The Seducer</a>**. Your patron is an entity that rules over lust, temptation, and the night. Fey, fiends, and enchanters each have their own angle for toying with mortal desires.

    **<a href="#internal-weaverLies">The Weaver of Lies</a>**. The speech of a god is the act of creation itself, but what happens when the gods lie? The small accumulated deceptions come together, forming a creature of webs and treachery, lies and deceit. It is called the Weaver, but it is a being woven from the lies of the gods themselves. Its influence is felt each day in the small comforts one tells oneself to the greatest of blasphemies against the divine concordant. You have joined its servants in your lust for power or desire to forget.

As the demon lord of magic and forbidden lore, Abraxas knows countless destructive secrets and eldritch magical formulas, particularly those that cause great devastation and pain. His greatest weapon is the dreaded "Final Incantation", a single potent word that can unmake magic.

Abraxas dwells in the realm of Pleroma, a deceptive world of false paradise maintained by complex illusions and clever construction. A visitor to Pleroma may not even realize she wanders an Abyssal realm, as the nefarious region reshapes itself between blinks and around every corner into places the traveler might view as serene and beautiful. Abraxas himself rules Pleroma from the spiral city of Diovengia. Hypnotic in its beauty, Diovengia consists of thousands of library towers and fortified repositories of hidden knowledge. Populated by serpents, enslaved souls, and plenty of demons, Diovengia’s libraries are sometimes visited by brave and curious seekers of knowledge; although one must be wary when bargaining with the custodians therein.

On Golarion, one can expect to find small cults of Abraxas in most large cities. He is also venerated by sadistic wizards, sorcerers and scholars who seek forbidden knowledge. His cult is particularly strong in Nex's capital city of Quantium, where it maintains a notorious library called Scrivenbough, a fortified stone structure with countless rare books in its holdings, and cultists who tattoo the greatest secrets on hidden parts of their bodies.

#### Quirks
Each warlock who delves into the secrets of Abraxas' archives is touched in a different way by the foul knowledge and ancient arts that lie within. Many develop strange habits and unusual practices, while others are physically marked during the rituals and practices they perform and the prices that must be paid to achieve ownership of the power they wield. When creating a warlock, consider adding one or more of the following traits to your character.

#### Abraxas Warlock Quirks
| d12 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You rarely speak louder than a whisper, and compulsively hush other people. |
| 2 | You can't stand to see others handle books in your presence, and take them away immediately. |
| 3 | You constantly chant a single phrase under your breath in a language you don't understand. |
| 4 | Whenever you hear a secret, you write it down. |
| 5 | You keep a record of the events of each day and store it within a tome you allow no others to see. |
| 6 | Your skin becomes pale like parchment. |
| 7 | You always hold books as far away from you as possible.
| 8 | Your tears are black like ink, and stain heavily. |
| 9 | Thick black veins run through your arms and legs. Occasionally, they twitch. |
| 10 | Your hands are always stained with ink, even after being washed.
| 11 | Your irises become red, with black veins running through them. Sometimes you can see the veins form words.
| 12 | Blood placed on your skin appears to form runic sigils. You're not certain what they mean. |

### Tainted Knowledge
You have feasted your eyes upon books from the libraries of Diovengia, and your mind has both withered and grown. Gain 1 skill points to spend on each of the *Arcana*, *History*, *Nature* or *Religion* skills.

You can use an ***action*** to enter the Accursed Archives of Diovengia along with up to ten willing companions of your choosing that you can see. Time does not pass outside the Archive while you are within, and you cannot rest, recover hit points, or maintain concentration while inside. For more information on the Archive, see the ”*Inside the Archive*” section. When you choose to depart, you and your companions return instantly to the point from which you entered.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Heretical Revelation
You can whisper terrible secrets to an adjacent target as an ***action***. The target can resist with a Wisdom save aginst your spell save DC. If the target fails its save, it is incapacitated for 1 round, then confused for 1d4 rounds, and then frightened of you for 2d6 rounds. The target does not need to understand you, but must be able to hear.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest.

### Vile Heresies
You uncover secrets that could shatter the balance of the heavens and hells. Choose any spell of 4th level or lower that is not a cantrip. You can cast this spell once using a warlock spell slot and can regain its use after you finish a long rest.

Whenever you are within the Archive, you can exchange this spell for a different one, but cannot use it until you finish a long rest. You cannot exchange the spell if you have already cast the spell and have not completed a long rest to restore it.

### Penultimate Incantation
You can affect a any number of creatures within 30 ft with a *dispel magic*. Each spell or effect dispelled inflicts fire damage to the target equal to the result of your caster level check made to dispel that effect.

Once you have used this ability, you may not use it again until you have completed a short rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Abraxas to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Agonizing Incantation
    *"The terrible secrets of the accursed archive are always gnawing at your mind. You temporarily get some respite when sharing the words. It's not your fault that people can not handle it."*

    When you cast the *ruin* cantrip, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Butcher’s Quill
    *Using your Pact of the Blade feature, you can create a weapon wrapped in raven feathers and the hide of abominations that drips and bleeds black ink.*

    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you can cast a single spell you know of 1st level with a casting time of one ***bonus action*** without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Curse of Carasphyx
    *Your flesh grows corrupt in appearance, being more dried parchment than mortal skin, but is imbued with terrible might.*

    While you are not wearing armor or using a shield, you can choose to have your AC equal 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. In addition, as an ***action*** you can gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points.

- #### Dreadful Word
    *You always enunciate very carefully, so as to avoid accidentally speaking the dreadful word that silently struggles to your lips.*

    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast *confusion* once without using a warlock spell slot. When you do, each affected creature is also frightened of you. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

</div>

## Inside the Archive
While few have ventured into the accursed archives of Diovengia, those who do cannot help but be drawn through the opening halls to gaze upon the tome in the center of the room - Index Incarnatus - the endless book that contains the location and description of every  scrap of forbidden lore within the city. Even gazing upon it for mere moments can cause discomfort, and reading from it can cause agony to both the body and the soul. Any creature that attempts to read from the Index must make a Intelligence save against DC 20. If they fail, they gain a level of exhaustion, but might still locate the correct tome or scroll.

### The Silent One
Each time a person speaks or makes noise within the archives, the DM should roll a d20. If the result is a 1, the person has attracted the attention of the Silent One: a terrifying, tentacled nightmare of unspeakable strength that exists with the sole purpose of curating and protecting the knowledge hidden here. The Silent One is blind, but has keen hearing and long tendrils that cannot be truly harmed by ordinary magic or metal, only driven back for mere moments. The creature is deceptively quick, seeming to flow slowly between each motion.

#### A Nightmarish Visage
While the Silent One appears before each person who has entered the Archive in a different way, all describe it as large, powerful, and extremely dangerous. Some claim it looks similar to a hound, blind and eyeless, with massive teeth and an eerie walk that conceals its speed. They say tendrils spiral from its back, laying around the hallways waiting to ensnare someone walking without sufficient caution.

Others claim it looks like a bat, with large wings and ears that twitch atop a mass of tentacles. Those who have seen this incarnation claim it swoops down from the highest bookshelves, crashing into unfortunate souls before pinning them beneath its unholy mass and devouring them alive. Few see it as a serpent, silently flickering a tongue-like tendril that enables it to seek out those who are quiet enough to hide from it. A rare number call it a spider, sitting within a web of limbs and tentacles, waiting for a fly to stumble upon it.

Those who have fallen to madness after seeing the beast multiple times claim all of these answers are wrong, and put forth an even more disturbing hypothesis: There is not merely a single Silent One, but many. Each that greets the next unfortunate soul is one of the previous victims of the beasts, transformed into their worst nightmare by the unspeakable powers that dwell within the darkest depths of the Archive. Few believe these tales, of course, but they are hard to shake. After all, those who have attempted to resurrect individuals who've fallen to the beast have failed, even when using the most powerful of magic.

#### Hunting Methods
Each turn this creature is hunting the party, randomly choose one target, prioritizing those who have spoken loudly or who have damaged writings within the Archive. The target must make an appropriate saving throw or ability check with a DC equal to 10 plus the character's level. If they succeed, they manage to flee, quiet themselves sufficiently, or fend off the monstrosity for a moment, buying time for the rest of the party to complete their work.

If they fail, the dark tendrils of the creature dig into their skin with unnerving ease, injecting a maddening and wriggling mass of unnatural flesh before withdrawing, which inflicts a level of exhaustion. If a member of the party gains six levels of exhaustion, they are seized by the beast and dragged into the depths of the Archive to meet a dark and twisted fate.

### Leaving the Archive
The party can depart from the Archive by returning to the central hall and striking the small bell located beside the Index as an action. Each person striking the bell instantly departs and returns to the location from which they entered the Archive, with no time having passed from the moment they left.

Creatures of innate magic and eons-old intelligence, dragons are beings of legend, fate, destruction, and destiny incarnate. Though it is a secret known to few, the truly ancient of their kind are able to share their inner magic with mortals by taking part in an eldritch ritual involving a contract and an elixir of the ancient dragon's own blood suffused with the dragon's potent magical will. This ritual binds the mortal to their ancient draconic patron, sharing in the power of the dragon's blood and gaining a ortion of the dragon's own magic.

Dragons are fickle, however, and notorious hoarders of both treasure and power, neither of which they give up without an abundantly good reason. What could have influenced your draconic patron to give up a (even quite small) portion of their power, and what does the dragon hope to gain by it? How involved is your patron in your affairs, and why did they choose you to bear some of their power? Often, these are questions that even the warlock has to ponder, as the true intent of a dragon is hidden to all but the most calculating, or truly insane, minds.

### Breath of the Ancients
The dragon that has chosen to bestow power upon you has lent a distinct character to the abilities you possess. Choose the option that corresponds with your patron's ancestry on the table below.

| Dragon | Damage type | Breath Weapon |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Black | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line |
| Blue | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line |
| Brass| Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line |
| Bronze | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line |
| Сорper | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line |
| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Green| Poison | 15 ft. cone |
| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Silver | Cold |  15 ft. cone |
| White | Cold | 15 ft. cone |

You gain a breath weapon based on the heritage of your patron, which you may use as an ***action*** on your turn. This breath weapon targets all creatures in its listed area (starting from your location). Targets  must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or a Constitution saving throw instead if your patron's damage type is cold or poison.

If a creature fails this saving throw, it takes damage of your patron's damage type, equal to your warlock level + your Intelligence modifier, or half this amount if it succeeds on the saving throw.

Once you use this ability, you must take a short rest before you can use it again.

### Dragonscales
You can call upon the scales of your patron to burst forth in patches upon your body, protecting you from harm. As a ***reaction*** when you are hit by an attack, you may extend your dragonscales and add your Intelligence modifier to your AC until the beginning of your next turn. This bonus to AC also applies against the attack that triggered this ability, and may cause the triggering hit to instead become a miss.

Once you have used this ability, you may not use it again until you have completed a short rest.

### Blood of Dragons
Gain resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic patron, as selected in your Breath of the Ancients feature.

If you are included in the area of a spell or feature effect that deals damage, and you succeed on a saving throw imposed by that spell or effect, you become enraged with the fury of your patron. While enraged, the first attack you make before the end of your next turn deals 2d6 additional damage of your patron's damage type.

### Draconic Apotheosis
You can assume the form of an aspect of your draconic patron for up to a minute. You may sprout horns, grow scales, gain burning draconic eyes, and take on other features directly reminiscent of your draconic lord.

You can transform on your turn using a ***bonus action***, which grants the the following abilities:

- Webbed dragon wings sprout from your back, granting you a flying speed of 60 ft.
- As a ***bonus action*** on your turn, you may level your draconic gaze at a creature within 60 ft. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for one minute. A creature affected by this repeats this save at the end of each of its turns, and a creature that saves against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.
- The damage caused by your Breath of the Ancients increases by 10, and the damage dice from your Blood of Dragons feature increase from 2d6 to 2d12.

Once you have used this ability, you may not use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Ancient Dragon to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Ancient's Hoard
    *Prerequisites: 7th level*

    As an action, you may cast *Leomunds secret chest* without expending a spell slot or material components. This summons an (initially) empty chest from your patron's hoard. When you dismiss this chest, it returns to your patron's hoard, rather than the Ethereal plane.

    Cast in this way, the spell does not end after 60 days. Rather, every 60 days your patron will expect you to include a fitting tribute in your chest, and will remove it from the chest accordingly. What an individual patron considers to be a fitting tribute differs from patron to patron.

    If no tribute is paid, your patron will take what they see fit. A warlock that empties their chest specifically to prevent their patron taking tribute will incur their patron's wrath, and everything that entails.

- #### Draconic Vigor
    *Your skin visibly and physically toughens, being more scales than mortal skin.*

    You can toughen your skin as an ***action***,, gaining a base AC equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. Your skin returns to normal after a short rest unless you dismiss this ability early. In addition, while active you can gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points at will, as an ***action***.

- #### Drain Mana
    *You have learned to draw the power of your spells into your own body.*

    As a ***bonus action*** you can spend one of your spell slots to recharge your Breath of the Ancients, Dragonscales and Draconic Apotheosis features.

- #### Dragonling
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Chain*

    When you have a pseudodragon as your familiar, you may use your spell save DC for its Sting ability. Further, you may use your pseudodragon as the origin point of your Breath of the Ancients ability, and you may use your Dragonscales ability as a ***reaction*** to increase your pseudodragon's AC when it is attacked, instead of increasing your own.

- #### Dragon Lore
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Tome, 9th level*

    While holding your Tome, you can cast *identify* or *legend lore* without expending a spell slot or material components. After casting *legend lore*, you must complete a long rest before casting it with this feature again.

- #### Dragontooth Glaive
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Blade*

    You can create a long spear-like glaive topped with a serrated dragon's tooth using your Pact feature. When you hit a creature with your glaive, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 1d8 + 1d8 per spell level damage of your patrons damage type. When you deal this damage, the target becomes frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn.

- #### Elemental Blade
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade*

    Whenever you summon your pact blade, you may choose for it to deal damage of the type associated with your patron instead of its normal damage type.

- #### Elemental Force
    *You share your patron's affinity for the elemental forces, reveling in the destruction it causes.*

    When you cast a cantrip that deals the same type of damage associated with your patron, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Elemental Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to emit a wave of energy of from your pact shield, dealing the e type of damage  associated with your patron equal to your charisma modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

</div>

You’ve made a pact with a being of immense size and strength. Sitting in a large, palatial temple within a network of mystical swamps, woods, and rivers lies the Ancient Toad, a creature of knowledge, magic, and power. Generally concerned with only its own realm and its preservation, the Ancient Toad rules over the various denizens that reside within it, from the smallest frogs and tadpole servants to the largest toad brutes and sages.

Though it rarely leaves its own home, the Ancient Toad often sends its minions out into the world to observe the comings and goings of other realms, or to gather items and resources that can benefit its homeland. The Ancient Toad admires mortals who adhere to laws, seek to better their people through whatever means necessary, or desire strength and power to accomplish goals that would not harm the Ancient Toad or its minions.

#### Quirks of the Toad Sage
The life of living amongst toads, frogs, and other amphibians has changed aspects of your appearance and personality. Consider the following quirks when creating a warlock under the Ancient Toad. You may use as many of the following quirks as you like.

#### Quirks
| d14 | Quirks |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | You love swimming in rivers and pods.
| 2 | You sometimes eat flies or small insects.
| 3 | Your irises are shaped like that of a toad or frog.
| 4 | Your tongue becomes elongated and thicker.
| 5 | You enjoy speeling on moss or cool stone.
| 6 | Your eyes appear to slightly bulge outward.
| 7 | Your skin becomes damp and smooth, like that of a frog.
| 8 | Your skin becomes dry and bumpy, like that of a toad.
| 9 | You tend to prefer warmer or temperate climates, and dislike the cold.
| 10 | Your hands and feet have large webbings between fingers and toads.
| 11 | Your hair tends to look greasy or damp.
| 12 | You tend to dart your tongue out when hungry or deep in throught.
| 13 | You often enjoy the company of others, in both leisure and work.
| 14 | You tend to be highly loyal to your friends and family.

### Speech of the Amphibious
Your familiarity with toads and frogs has given you insight into how they live. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You also learn the *acid splash* and *acicid discharge* cantrips.

Additionally, you can speak to toads, frogs, and other amphibians as if you were under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell.

### Call of the Swamp
Frogs and toads can come to your aid. As an ***action***, you can cast *conjure animals*, but you can only summon frogs or toads, including giant frogs and giant toads.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Traits of the Toad
You have learned even more from the toads. Gain immunity to acid and the poisoned condition.

Additionally, when you are subject to an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to leap into the air to an unoccupied location within 30 ft of you, potentially avoiding the effect.

You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short rest.

<div class="infoarea">

**Note**: The toad's name is up to the player, and this elite toad is always the one that is summoned, unless stated otherwise by the DM. It can speak and communicate in ways dictated by its simple personality, such as being cautious, hot headed, calm, or timid.

</div>

### Friend of the Toad
One of the strongest of toads has become your ally. By speaking its name, you can summon a monstrous humanoid toad to aid you in combat, appearing as either a green, red, brown, or black toad, and armed with a large club and a simple vest. This creature acts under your command during its turn, and can speak, and possesses a simple personality. The toad remains until it dies, you dismiss it, or one minute has passed.

You can summon the monstrous toad once and can regain the use of this feature after you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Ancient Toad to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Breath of the Toad
    *Prerequisites: 7th level*

    You gain the use of one of the toad's greatest assets: a breath weapon that takes the form of an oily expulsion, coating in a slimy oil any enemies that would stand in your way.

    As an ***action*** each creature in a 15 ft cone must make a saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 6d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.

    You regain use of this feature after a long rest.

- #### Dissolving Acid
    When you cast a cantrip that deals acid damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals, to one of the main targets of the spell. That creature's AC is reduced by 1 until the end of your next turn.

- #### Hive Keeper
    *Prerequisites: Conjure insects cantrip*

    For one minute after casting the *conjure insects* cantrip, you are covered in a living armour of insects. You gain +1 to your AC for the duration. When a creature within 30 ft attacks you, you can use a ***reaction*** to cause the insect armour to jump to the attacker, ending the effect and dealing 1d10 piercing damage.

- #### Flesh of the Toad
    *You have learned to imitate the appearances of the toad to provide you with benefits.*

    *Prerequisite: 10th level*

    You can cast the spell *guardian of nature* without expending a warlock spell slot. However, the forms are changed to the **Great Toad** form.

    -- You gain 10 temporary hit points.<br/>
    -- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.<br/>
    -- You gain low-light vision with a range of 120 feet.<br/>
    -- You make Constitution saving throws with advantage.<br/>

    You regain use of this feature after a long rest.

- #### Home of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome*

    You can perform a ritual involving mud, oil, and verbal components over the course of 10 minutes. During the ritual, you can touch a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier. Theses creatures ignore difficult terrain caused by swamps or mud and their jump height is doubled. In addition, each creature is also able to breathe underwater. This lasts for 1 hour.

- #### Land of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: 14th level*

    You can cast *transmute rock* once per day without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Leap of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade*

    You can create a whip that appears like a long, frog tongue and is coated in a slimy liquid. This weapon deals acid or slashing damage, your choice. If a ranged attack misses you while wielding this weapon, you can use your ***reaction*** to jump up to 15 ft to an unoccupied space. If the attacker is within reach after your move, you can make a single melee attack against them with this weapon as part of the same reaction.

- #### Nature's Voice
    *Prerequisite: 14th level*

    You can cast *Commune with nature* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Pull of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade*

    When you strike a target with your pact weapon, you can force the target to make Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 ft of you, allowing you to make one melee attack against the target as a ***bonus action***.

- #### Tongue of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    Your tongue can now be used to seize your enemies. You can select a target that is of Medium size or smaller within 20 ft of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your Warlock spell DC. On a failed save, the target is restrained. The target can attempt to break free from the tongue at the beginning of each of their turns.

- #### Walk of the Toad
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain*

    When you have either a river frog or horned toad as your familiar, it gains additional maximum hit points equal to your warlock level, and whenever a creature fails a save against your familiar's breath, it becomes poisoned until the end of its turn.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiars
Warlocks who have been given the Pact of the Chain can choose to have either of the two following familiars: The Horned Toad or The River Frog.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### The Horned Toad
    The horned toad is a tiny creature that is infused with poisonous glands, horns, and have earth toned dry skin. Used often for communication and, horned toads are known for their dedication to work and friends. Horned toads often attack with their poison breath, emitting low croaks, and rest on their master's shoulders or smooth stones.

- #### The River Frog
    River frogs of the Ancient Toad's dominion are quick thinkers and fast movers, often used for scouting the rivers and swampy waters of their home. They are tiny beasts, usually  reen, red, blue, black in color. They prefer the water and will often try to locate sources of food near riverbanks or ponds for their masters. River frogs are very loyal, and will fight with quick attacks from their acid breath. River frogs generally perch themselves in small pools of water or on their master's shoulders.

Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

#### Fey Presence
Your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an ***action***, you can cause each creature in a 10 ft cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws all gain the charmed condition or are frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

#### Misty Escape
You can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 ft to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

#### Beguiling Defenses
Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your ***reaction*** to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.

The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

#### Dark Delirium
You can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an ***action***, choose a creature that you can see within 60 ft. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken. This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.

You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Archfey to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Dreams of the Summer Court
    When you cast the *minor illusion* cantrip, its range is 300 ft, and you can choose the illusion to be imperceptible to any number of creatures you have seen in the past minute.

- #### Glamour of the Fey Folk
    *Your patron has blessed you with unearthly beauty.*

    *Prerequisites: 9th level*

    When you cast a charm spell, targets have disadvantage on saving throws against the spell if they can see you.

- #### Mask of Many Faces
    *You begin to slowly assemble a more perfect image of yourself as you use this ability. You tweak your nose, your eyes, your teeth until you have achieved a perfect mask that represents yourself. Over time you begin to resent your actual physical appearance, hiding it whenever possible.*

    You can cast *disguise* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot.

- #### Nature's Voice
    *Prerequisite: 14th level*

    You can cast *commune with nature* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Whispered Temptations
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Talisman feature*

    If a creature carrying your talisman is charmed by a spell cast through it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC once the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature does not recognise your talisman as the source of the spell even if the creature would have reason to suspect it.

Within every fire, there is an insatiable and gluttonous greed. A simple and pure predatory urge to consume, feast, and burn until nothing is left. Wood, flesh, and metal alike bow before the furious supremacy of the flame. The Ashen Wolf is a physical manifestation of this terrible hunger. Some call it a fiend from the blackest pit, others call it an elemental creature. Nevertheless, it is living, it is hungry, and it burns for the thrill of the hunt.

#### The Voice of the Fire
Those who have laid eyes upon the Wolf and lived describe it as a being of unquestionable presence. It is a massive lupine creature with eyes like the fires of a burning home, fur that smolders in the dark, a cloak of smoky ash, teeth of sharpened steel that gleam in the light, and a deep voice that carries like the whisper of a struck match in a quiet forest.

While the Wolf is ever-hungry, it seeks more than mere meat. It hungers for conflict, companionship, and the freedom to roam and burn. Often surrounded by emberborn, small wolf-like fire elementals, it hunts the forests of the world for ancient beasts, cunning prey, and lost wanderers.

#### A Dangerous Bargain
The Ashen Wolf is known to the mortal races from the stories told of those who have gone to entreat this beast, begging for aid, power, or control over their own destiny. The Wolf is known to grant these requests, but the price for this boon is cruel and terrible by all accounts.

The Wolf delights in the suffering of mortals it does not consider within its pack, and thus payment often comes in the form of a curse that plagues the supplicant forevermore. Those that survive often regret their decision, in the end.

<img src='https://static.wixstatic.com/media/54abec_c742d959c92f46058c564ca7aa5fe1f8~mv2_d_2550_1500_s_2.jpg_256' style='float:left;width:45%;padding:20px' />

#### Sign of the Burning Harvest
Cultures that lie within the untamed lands beyond the civilized world are often more familiar with the Ashen Wolf than those who dwell within the cities, though even their knowledge is often rife with superstition. The Wolf seems to enjoy the sacrifices made in its name and responds favorably to those who perform the proper rituals, sending its emberborn servants to hunt the beasts that plague its supplicants or to purge outcasts and criminals from their land. If the fields burn and the granaries are destroyed in the process, then that is the price of the hungering flame.

The Wolf is often symbolized with a flag coated in ash with prominent markings of fangs or claw-prints drawn in red or orange paint. In some cultures, magically-heated metal is twisted into unusual shapes and pressed into trees to mark the domain of the Wolf’s servants.

### The Pact
You’ve made a pact with a primal spirit of fire and the hunt – a scourge of the forests and fields, and a harbinger of ill fate. This creature is wise and cunning, making deals with those who have the potential to bring ruin and change. Some consider the beast to be native to the Plane of Elemental Fire; others call it a fiend from the darkest hells. Whatever its origin, the ember-eyed wolf often extracts payment in the form of wishes gone awry: a demand for power becomes a battle to retain one’s humanity, while a request for a peaceful resolution often has a price that brings constant regret.

#### Quirks of the Ashen
Warlocks who have made a pact with the Ashen Wolf are often known simply as ashen. Consider adding one or more of these quirks when creating a warlock or after performing an action that would please the Wolf.

#### Quirks
| d16 | Quirks |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | You eat your meat raw or badly burned. |
| 2 | You habitually start fires using damp or wet wood. |
| 3 | You have a strange hostility to cats. |
| 4 | You prefer to sleep on the ground rather than a bed. |
| 5 | You talk to fire, and sometimes, it answers.
| 6 | Smoke slowly swirls around your head and limbs. |
| 7 | Sparks appear when your skin is rubbed. |
| 8 | Your tears are black like ink, and stain heavily. |
| 9 | Food you eat always tastes like ash. |
| 10 | Your breath often comes out as a cloud of smoke.
| 11 | Your teeth become eerily large and sharp.
| 12 | Your fingernails become dark and claw-like.
| 13 | Your eyes glow like hot coals.
| 14 | You always sit closest to the fire.
| 15 | A thin layer of ash constantly flakes off your skin.
| 16 | You compulsively scratch your fingers on wood.

### Breath of Smoke
You can use your ***action*** to exhale blistering embers in a 15 ft cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. Creature that fail take fire damage equal to your warlock level + your Intelligence modifier and are blinded until the end of their next turn.

If you activate this feature again before finishing a long rest, you gain one level of exhaustion.

Additionally, you can breathe and see normally in smoke or ash-filled air.

### Feast for the Fire
When you damage a creature with fire, you mark it as a sacrifice to the Ashen Wolf.

If it is killed while adjacent to you, before the end of your next turn, you can use a ***reaction*** to incinerate it, leaving it a pile of ash. You gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level, and can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself.

### Endless Pursuit
Your patron grants you a portion of its primal stamina. You gain resistance to fire damage. When you finish a short rest, you can choose to reduce your level of exhaustion by one.

You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Beast of the Burning End
You unlock the power to incarnate into the form of your patron. As an ***action***, you wrap yourself in the guise of a massive flaming lupine creature. For 1 minute, or until you exit this incarnation as a ***bonus action***, you gain the following benefits.

 * Your size becomes Large.
 * You ignore all levels of exhaustion.
 * Your speed increases by 20 ft.
 * You have advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is adjacent to the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
 * You are immune to fire damage.

When you use this feature, two **hell hounds** burst forth from your burning flesh. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required). If you don’t issue any commands to them or are incapacitated, they defend themselves and you from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. They act on your initiative count, have twice as many hit points as a normal hell hound, and are considered elementals instead of their normal type.

When you exit this incarnation, the hell hounds instantly turn to ash. Your body immediately attempts to reabsorb the ash as it swirls back to you from up to 300 feet away. If a hell hound has died or the ash cannot return to you due to distance, you gain one level of exhaustion per missing hound.

You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Ashen Wolf to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Chronicle of the Flame
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    You can perform a 10 minute ritual for the Wolf during a long rest. When you do so, choose either Dexterity or Strength saving throws. When you make a saving throw of this type, you can use your ***reaction*** to gain advantage on that saving throw and cast a cantrip with a casting time of one action. Once you do that, you cannot do so again until you finish long rest.

- #### Essence of Ash
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    If you have an emberborn as your familiar, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level plus twice your Intelligence modifier.

    When you reach 11th level, the emberborn can grow in size to become a Medium creature, at your discretion. While it is Medium, its bite attack deals 2d6 piercing damage and 2d6 fire damage, and the emberborn’s speed increases to 50 feet. Creatures hit by the bite attack must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

    At 16th level, a Medium emberborn’s bite attack deals 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 fire damage, and the Strength saving throw DC equals your warlock spell save DC.

- #### Fiery Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to emit a blast of fire from your pact shield, dealing fire damage equal to your charisma modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

- #### Hellfire Infusion
    Whenever you deal damage with a cantrip or weapon, you can use your ***bonus action*** to empower it with elemental fire. The attack deals fire damage instead of its normal damage type, and enemies adjacent to the target take necrotic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier as black ash bursts from its body.

- #### Hunger of the Wolf
    On your turn, when you score a critical hit with an attack or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can cast any cantrip that targets an enemy creature as a ***bonus action***.

- #### Relentless Tracker
    You can add your Intelligence modifier to checks you make to hunt or track a creature below its maximum hit points, or that has recently suffered a major injury. Additionally, you can smell the scent of creatures below their maximum hit points from up to a mile away, allowing you to accurately pinpoint the distance and direction to them.

- #### Through Fire and Flame
    *Prerequisite: 13th level*

    Whenever you would take fire damage or are exposed to damaging flame, you can use your ***reaction*** to absorb the elemental fire as an offering to the Ashen Wolf. The damage is negated, and instead you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you would have taken before resistances and immunities. The amount of temporary hit points received at one time cannot exceed three times your Intelligence modifier.

    You can use this invocation twice, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to the Ashen who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Emberborn
  An emberborn is a small, canine-like creature created from ash and burning embers built around a core of molten metal. They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.

  When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-blackthornGrove">The Blackthorn Grove</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Blackthorn Heart
| 6th | Apathy is Death
| 10th | Arboreal Guardian
| 14th |Seeds of Destruction

</div>

Nature possesses a beauty that is only rivaled by the works of the finest minds of mortals, yet it is not a beauty born from will and determination, but from single-minded apathy to everything but oneself. Those who wander, departing from society due to misery or tragedy, who enter the untouched wildlands to find themselves will end up somewhere dark and perilous. The Blackthorn Grove is their destination, whether they know it or not.

#### The Maze of Blood
Lost and stranded, yet unafraid and uncaring of the outcome, the wandering souls will find themselves within a maze of bloody brambles and roses blacker than ink. Those who are weakened by their journey often fall here and are feasted upon by the vines that burrow into their corpses. The vines move with deliberate motions, causing dead jaws to open before snapping shut and broken teeth to grind in a symphony of suffering.

The ones who close their hearts to the cruelty inflicted upon the dead find themselves called forward, deeper into the maze. They will face obstacles that are insurmountable without sacrifice, their clothing and armor torn to shreds by the thorns of the black roses as they watch the plants feast upon their crimson bounty.

#### The Fields of Acedia
The few who manage to enter the Maze of Blood and survive to find the exit are greeted by broad fields of flowers, endless in variety and color. Small copses of trees bearing fruits unseen by those in the outside world dot the landscape, and a stream runs through the center filled with pure water. In short, it would seem to be a paradise by comparison to those who suffered such a harrowing journey.

However, this place is far more dangerous than the Maze, for it does not harvest the body, but the mind. Those who enter this place and feast upon the fruits and drink of the water find that the wounds they suffered within the Maze of Blood shall not heal. Instead, they continue to slowly drip that precious crimson ichor upon the roots of the flowers and trees, the blood loss numbing the pain of the journey. Those who partake do not care, however, as their minds are filled with the pleasures of their meal.

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/dc/9d/28dc9d8e6d9170283ec8703f432dfb7c.png' style='float:left;width:45%;padding:20px' />

#### The Heart of Rebirth
The wanderers who care not for the false temptations of the Fields while seeking the true purpose of this otherworldly place inevitably find themselves standing before the entrance to the Blackthorn Grove. Within, they are consumed by the disdain they feel for both themselves and the world, and use the thorns as claws to tear their own hearts from their chests, offering them as tribute to the single flower within.

In response, the Blackthorn burrows into the gap where their heart once was, filling them with purpose – to grow, to fight, to live, and to see the world with eyes unclouded by hate. Reborn, they revel in the emotions abandoned within the Maze and Fields, now seeking the joy of life. However, the heart rooted in their chest thirsts for blood, and they will be instinctively drawn to violent conflict and suffer a lust for power. It is the nature of a grove to seek to spread and grow, after all, and only the most powerful can provide fertile soil for the seed of the Blackthorn Grove.

### The Pact
You’ve torn out your heart as an offering to the Blackthorn Grove after braving the Maze of Blood and resisting the temptations of the Fields of Acedia. In place of your heart, a pulsing, beating, writhing mass of thorns has grown and made you whole. The lifeblood of the world itself runs through your veins, granting you power and passion alike to fulfill your purpose, whatever that may be. The trials and suffering of your past beckon you to make amends or take your revenge, but the feeling of grass under your feet and the sunlight upon your face is enough to help you understand the worth of life. Wander alone no longer, for even in death the Grove shall grant you a home.

#### Quirks of the Thornhearted
Warlocks who draw power from the Blackthorn Grove are called thornhearted and are often secretive about their origins, instead preferring to converse about more pressing matters. Their secrecy is often born of necessity, as most have enemies that would love to see them dead. Consider adding one or more of these quirks when creating a warlock or after drawing heavily from the power of the Grove.

#### Quirks
| d10 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You smile and laugh without reservation. |
| 2 | You weep openly whenever you feel despair. |
| 3 | You dislike cities and urban areas. |
| 4 | You make inspiring speeches with surprising frequency. |
| 5 | Your flesh seems to ripple under your skin.
| 6 | Your irises become blood red with green streaks. |
| 7 | Your facial features become accentuated by small plantlike growths that cover your cheekbones or brow. |
| 8 | Your hair becomes long strands of grass and leaves. |
| 9 | Wooden horns emerge from your forehead. |
| 10 | Whenever you cast a spell, your Blackthorn heart pulses with crimson energy. |

### Blackthorn Heart
You have torn out your heart and replaced it with something otherworldly, granting you the will to survive. Whenever you fail a death saving throw, your Blackthorn heart bursts from your chest and lashes out with life-stealing briars toward a creature within 15 ft. The briars target the nearest hostile creature if possible, but if no hostile creatures are in range, any target will do. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the creature takes magical piercing damage equal to your warlock level, and you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.

After you recover hit points using this feature, you cannot make this attack again until you finish a short rest.

### Apathy is Death
You can use your ***reaction*** to surge with purpose and haste whenever you make an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. You gain advantage on the saving throw, and can make a single weapon attack before the result of the roll is revealed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest.

### Arboreal Guardian
Your purpose is not merely to exist, but to safeguard life. Whenever an adjacent creature would take damage, you can choose to redirect half of the damage to you by shielding them with vines from your Blackthorn heart. Only the original target suffers any additional effects of the damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you gain advantage on the first attack made by your Blackthorn Heart feature.

### Seeds of Destruction
You realize the reason you have been blessed with this power and purpose: to spread the Blackthorn Grove. As an ***action***, or whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points and you fail to recover hit points using your Blackthorn Heart feature, you can choose to have the beginnings of a new Maze of Blood appear around you. The area within a 30 ft radius becomes difficult terrain as blood-hungry vines emerge from the assembled briars to drink their fill.

A creature within the area at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. A target takes 4d6 magical slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Allies make this saving throw with advantage. If summoned as an action, it lasts until the start of your next turn. If summoned when you are at 0 hit points, it lasts until you recover 1 hit point, or becomes permanent if you die.

The Maze can be summoned once as an action, and this use recovers whenever you finish a long rest. The Maze can also be summoned once when you are at 0 hit points, and this use recovers whenever you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Blackthorn Grove to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Awakened Blade
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    You can choose to create a weapon from polished black wood and wicked spines using your Pact of the Blade feature. If you are maintaining concentration on a spell while wielding this weapon, dense foliage covers your skin, causing your AC to equal 17 if it would normally be lower.

- #### Book of the Blackthorn
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    During a long rest, you can create an effigy from plant material, weaving and shaping it into a heart. You can replace the heart of a dead creature with this effigy as a 1 minute ritual, causing it to rise as a zombie with 1 hit point under your control. If the zombie is destroyed you can reclaim the effigy using a 1 minute ritual. If you create a new effigy, the previous one ceases to function, and the zombie crumbles to the ground, a lifeless corpse once more.

- #### Curse of the Thornhearted
    *Your flesh grows corrupt in appearance, being more dried bark than mortal skin, but imbued with terrible might.*

    Your base AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. In addition, as an action you can gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points at will.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Thornhearted warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Bloodless Wanderer
    Not all who have torn their hearts away in the Blackthorn Grove survive their adventures. Some fall in battle, dying before their quests have been completed. For many, this is the end, but for some, it offers a new beginning. Each bloodless wanderer is the blackthorn heart of one of these fallen heroes, whose ambitions and desires were never fulfilled. The heart tears itself from the chest of the fallen adventurer, seeking still to fulfill its quest. All of them require blood to continue to survive, and will feast upon the fallen, drinking deeply of their still-fresh fluids.

    They are often referred to as spirits of the dead, though this is not technically correct. They are plants. They desire little more than to find new companions who can assist them on their lifelong quest, but are patient and capable of understanding the bigger picture when required. The one thing that will cause a wanderer to attempt disobedience is the sight of their killer. If a bloodless wanderer is placed within a corpse, it can animate the body to act and move, but it will still lack the ability to communicate beyond gestures and cryptic behavior.

    ***Bloodsucking Vines.*** Whenever the bloodless wanderer deals slashing or piercing damage, it recovers hit points equal to the damage dealt. This does not apply if the target does not have blood.

    ***Corpse Thief.*** When the wanderer is touching the corpse of a beast or humanoid with a CR of 2 or less, it can use an ***action*** to enter and animate the body like a puppet. While inside, it gains temporary hit points equal to half the maximum hit points of the dead creature. When these temporary hit points are reduced to zero, the corpse is destroyed and the wanderer is ejected. The wanderer can choose to leave as a bonus action.

    ***Magic Resistance.*** The bloodless wanderer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Mechanical Arcana, Warped Reality
| 6th | Defensive Protocol
| 10th | Axiomatic Mind
| 14th |The Maker's Monolith

</div>

Your patron is Primus, The One and the Prime, supreme ruler of the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus and overarching will, mind and soul of the Modron race. Primus, its plane and its creations all represent the fundamental concept of universal law: that all is right happens because it must inescapably be, and all that which is wrong must not be. Thus, though Primus's primary concern always lies with the Modrons, it also takes the role of extraplanar arbiter, ensuring that certain events - from upholding sworn oaths, to assuring the punishment of any devil that breaches a contract - do or do not come to pass. Even the vast resources of Mechanus cannot cover the breadth of the planes, and hence, Primus turns to mortal warlocks to enact its will.

The One and the Prime insists its operatives follow their directives to the letter. Its warlocks can expect to be sent on tasks of tremendous variety - one day, ensuring the marriage of two peasant lovers in an isolated village, the next, delivering buried treasure to its owners next of kin against impossible odds.

Your physical appearance might have been changed in some way by your relationship to the machine and your pact spells are all cosmetically altered to reflect the machine's technologically advanced themes.

#### Quirks
The behaviour of the warlock of the Machine patron is not often directly influenced by their benefactor, but serving a being so alien to the thoughts and emotions of most living creatures tends to have lingering effects. The following quirks are made to give a little flavour to one who has made a pact with constructs of immense power.

#### Machine Warlock Quirks
| d8 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You are obsessed with the form and function of all objects, particularly ones with moving parts. |
| 2 | You have an overbearing contempt for any tradition that defies logical reasoning. |
| 3 | You find it difficult to convey subtle emotion. |
| 4 | You are irritated when a less optimal approach to a particular issue is taken. |
| 5 | Your movements are always methodical and deliberate unless you make an extra effort to appear natural. |
| 6 | Your face appears unnervingly perfect, similar to a porcelain mask. |
| 7 | You often ignore social convention in the face of logic. |
| 8 | Everything must be ordered, everything must be in place. That book should be in the shelf, that mop should be next to the bucket... |

### Mechanical Arcana
Learn the *mending* and *shocking grasp* cantrips, which do not count against your known cantrips.

### Warped Reality
You can briefly bend and contract space between you and a target within 60 ft, as part of an attack. This unexpected strike grants you advantage on your attack roll and also grants shorter ranged attacks a range of 60 ft, including melee attacks.

You may also use this feature to pick up an object, perform the Use Object action, or perform a touch spell on a willing creature within this range. You may not pick up an object that weighs more than 10 pounds.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Defensive Protocol
You can impose your will on an attacker, forcing them to cease their hostility. As a ***reaction*** when a creature within 60 ft targets you with an attack, spell or effect, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the target gains the charmed condition until the end of your next turn, until you deal damage to it, or until you force it to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Axiomatic Mind
Your course of action is yours alone to control. You are immune to the frightened condition, and whenever you are charmed or otherwise magically compelled to act against your will, you can make another saving throw against the spell or effect that you are charmed by, ending the effect on yourself on a success.

### The Maker's Monolith
You can summon an imposing column of stone or steel as an action; raising a 3 foot wide and 15 ft tall monument in an adjacent space.

This nigh invincible monolith acts as a conduit for your patron's power into this realm. You can spend 10 minutes forming any basic structures or objects made of non-magical metal, wood or stone, or altering terrain within 30 feet of this monolith. Objects or structures removed from this area will disintegrate after 1 minute, and terrain will revert to its natural form. In addition, you are mentally alerted when a creature of size Tiny or larger enters this area, as long as you are within 5 miles.

You can also teleport yourself and up to 4 other willing creatures within 10 ft to the base of the monolith as an ***action***, as long as you are within 5 miles of it. Once you teleport like this, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

This effect is active as long as you maintain concentration. If you concentrate for one hour after creating the monolith, this effect becomes permanent until you raise another monolith, then it will recede into the ground and all surrounding changes are reversed to their original state.

Once you raise a monolith, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Cosmic Machine to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Blood and Iron
    *Prerequisites: 7th level*

    When you expend a hit die to regain hit points, you can roll the die twice and pick the higher result, you can also reattach any dismembered limbs during a short or long rest. Additionally, you die on your fifth failed death saving throw instead of your third.

- #### Clockwork Guard
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade*

    When you create a pact weapon, you can choose to also conjure a magical suit of splint over your body, instantly donning it. The splint persists until you dismiss it as a ***bonus action***, or you die. While wearing this armor, you are considered proficient with it.

- #### Cold Calculation
    Gain 1 skill point to spend on the *Investigation* skill. Additionally *Perception - Keen Awareness* costs 0 to you.

- #### Crime and Punishment
    *Prerequisite: 3rd level*

    You know the *zone of truth* spell and can cast it without expending a spell slot. You can do this twice before requiring a long rest to do so again. When you cast *zone of truth* this way, and a creature inside its area lies, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is stable.

- #### High Voltage
    *Mystical circuitry is embedded under your skin, increasing the power of your electrical output. You and people around you often affected by sparks of static electricity.*

    When you cast a cantrip that deals lightning damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Inevitable Strike
    When you make an attack, you can choose to forgo rolling the attack and instead automatically hit the creature. If you do so, the weapon or spell's normal damage dice are maximized. Once you have used this invocation, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Lightning Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to emit a blast of lightning from your pact shield, dealing lightning damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

- #### Mechanic Vigor
    *After using this ability your skin visibly and physically toughens, being more metallic than mortal skin.*

    You can toughen your skin as an action, gaining a base AC equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. Your skin returns to normal after a short rest unless you dismiss this ability early. In addition, while active you can gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points at will as an ***action***.

- #### Seal of Primus
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Talisman feature*

    Your talisman can be placed on any entryway as an ***action***, casting the *arcane lock* spell without expending a spell slot or material components. It can also be placed on any mechanism smaller than a 10 ft cube, such as a lever or set of gears, which will cause it to seize up and jam instead of lock. While the object is under this spell you can open, close, activate or deactivate it as a ***bonus action*** as long as you are on the same plane of existence and the object wasn't initially locked or disabled.

    This spell will end if the lock is dispelled, if the talisman is removed from the target object, or if it is used to cast another spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Pact of the Chain Familiar

<div class="columnstwo">

- The following familiar is available to Machine patron warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature. Sentinel drones are small hovering automatons created with self-awareness to aid in their duties as guardians and scouts.

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Howls and Screeches, Toil and Trouble
| 6th | Baleful Glance, Blood of the Coven
| 10th | Walking Hovel, Flying Broom, Umbral Ward
| 14th |Familiar Curse

</div>

Your patron is a elder evil force in the world that veers capriciously between its maternal and destructive instincts. Such creatures smother those they hold dear with doting attention and reject those set against her with ruthless cruelty, often times vacillating between these extremes seemingly without prompt. You have chosen a spiteful and suffocating patron, one whose nature you find yourself more and more mimicking. Beings of this sort include; Aradia, mother of witchcraft, Baba Yaga, the evil woman, and Hecate, queen of witches.

### Howls and Screeches
You can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Toil and Trouble
Add *Herbalism* and *Craft - Alchemy* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on each of them.

Additionally you can prepare an enchanted brew during a long rest. When you do select one of the following potions to create, which all smells delicious and sweet.

**Everdream**. When consumed as a ***bonus action*** this tonic puts its drinker under a heavy lethargy as if you had cast the *spell* sleep with your highest level Pact Magic spell slot.

**Hale & Hearty**. When consumed as a ***bonus action*** this tonic heals its drinker as if you had cast *healing word* equivalent to your highest level Pact Magic spell slot.

**Love Potion**. When created you make a number of these potions equal to the highest spell level Pact Magic spell slot you have. When consumed as a ***bonus action*** the drinker falls under the effect of a *charm person* spell as if you had cast it.

These brews only stay potent only a few days. After that they turn putrid, foul and impotent. In game terms, you can have only one of each with at any time.

### Baleful Glance
As a ***reaction***, you can apply disadvantage to one attack roll made by a creature you can see within 60 ft against you. Creatures that are immune to being frightened are immune. You must finish a short rest before using this feature again.

### Blood of the Coven
When you cast a spell you can call out to your companions to shed blood for your power. One ally within 30 ft can spend their ***reaction*** to take 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell slot and your spell is empowered. If your spell includes a spell attack roll it gains advantage. If your spell includes a saving throw, the target creatures gain disadvantage on that roll.

### Umbral Ward
You can’t be charmed or frightened by fiends or fey, and you are immune to disease.

### Walking Hovel, Flying Broom
You can cast the spell *animate objects* without expending a spell slot. You can use this feature again after a long rest.

### Familiar Curse
You can touch an unconscious creature and turn it into any beast with a CR of 1 or lower. That beast then acts as your familiar as if you had cast the *find familiar* spell. As your familiar, the creature fears your mystical power and cannot summon the courage to do anything to defy your will. This effect ends when someone casts *remove curse* on the target or you use this feature again. In addition, you must name a condition that, if it comes to pass, functions as if a remove curse spell had been cast on the target. Choose one of the following conditions:

 **Devotion**. If the target has a sincere change of heart and is repentant for his transgression against you, a loyal servant to you for a year and a day, and begs your forgiveness. The Familiar Curse returns if they transgress you again and you have not used the feature again. In this case you do not select a condition.

 **Sacrifice**. If someone who cares for the target sheds tears over them and begs to serve their fate instead. The person who was pleading then takes over the Familiar Curse but you do not select a condition.

 **True Love**. If the target is recognized for who they are and kissed by someone who sincerely loves them and who they sincerely love. The Familiar Curse returns if they betray that person romantically and you have not used the feature again. In this case you do not select a condition.

If the effect ends due to a *remove curse* the creature reverts to its normal form and is conscious, if the effect ends due to you using this feature again the creature reverts to its normal form and remains unconscious until they are stirred awake or they have slept one hour for every month they lived as your familiar.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Crone to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Dance Macabre
    As an action, you may target one undead creature you can see within 30 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours. An undead creature whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.

    Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.

- #### Crone's Companions
    *Prerequisites: 14th level, Pact of the Chain*

    Your familiar takes a new shape. It is now a fey that can swap between two forms as an action: it can take the shape of a cat or a raven. As an ***action***, you may channel your power into your familiar, transforming it into a swarm of ravens or a panther. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.

    Once you trigger this transformation, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.

- #### Crone's Hobbies
    You may spend 2 skill points on one of the following skills: *Craft - Alchemy*, *Animal Handling*, *Medicine*, *Perception* and *Survival*. Whenever you complete a long rest, you may move these skills points.

- #### Curse of Conscription
    *Prerequisite: 7th level, Pact of the Evil eye*

    If a target affected by your *hex* is reduced to 0 HP, you may choose to end the spell and reanimate the target as a zombie under your control. You can command any zombies under your control as per the *animate dead* spell. When a zombie is reanimated from this feature, you have control over it for 24 hours.

- #### Hive Keeper
    *Prerequisites: Conjure insects cantrip*

    For one minute after casting the *conjure insects* cantrip, you are covered in a living armor of insects. You gain +1 to your AC for the duration. When a creature within 30 feet attacks you, you can use a ***reaction*** to cause the insect armour to jump to the attacker, ending the effect and dealing 1d10 piercing damage.

- #### Mask of Many Faces
    *You begin to slowly assemble a more perfect image of yourself as you use this ability. You tweak your nose, your eyes, your teeth until you have achieved a perfect mask that represents yourself. Over time you begin to resent your actual physical appearance, hiding it whenever possible.*

    You can cast *disguise* targeting yourself at will, without expending a spell slot.

- #### Nature's Voice
    *Prerequisite: 14th level*

    You can cast *Commune with nature* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-dagon">Dagon, Prince of Depths</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Depths of Knowledge, Pelagic Tentacle
| 6th | Sign of the Abyss
| 10th | Squamous Hide
| 14th |Drown in the Depths

</div>

Dagon, also called Prince of the Depths, is the demon lord of the sea, and the sea monsters that dwell in its darkest depths. His symbol is an octopus eye surrounded by a gold disk inscribed with ancient looking runes. His realm is the 89th layer of the Abyss, and it is known as Shadowsea. He dwells in the depths of this Abyssal sea, in an gigantic sunken city known as Ugothanok, a city with architecture so ancient as to be almost alien. Dagon is one of the oldest beings in the Abyss being one of the ancient Qlippoth, the creatures that dwelt in the abyss before demons.

The Prince of Depths is believed to be the largest of all the known demon lords. His appearance is hideously monstrous and somewhat alien, being neither fully fish, eel, or octopus; he is some foul amalgamation of all three.

Dagon is quite active on the Material Plane, regularly sending his demonic minions to the deep oceans of the world to become high priests for evil aquatic monster races. Unfortunately, Dagon's foul influence is not limited to the ocean depths; he is also revered by some debased coastline societies. In these twisted communities, land dwellers mix with ichthyic beings from the depths, spawning horrible cross-breeds which have no place in the natural order of things.

### Depths of Knowledge
You can use your ***action*** to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are on the ocean or underwater): aberrations, celestials and fiends and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creature's' location or number.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you take a long rest.

### Pelagic Tentacle
You are able to conjure a tentacle from the Ocean's depths to grasp at your foes. As a an ***action***, you may cause a tentacle to burst forth from an extraplanar space and attempt to grasp a creature within 30 ft. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, the creature's movement speed becomes 0 as the tentacle grasps them, and they cannot move (except by forced movement or teleportation) until the tentacle dissipates at the beginning of your next turn.

If target is swimming, you can also pull the creature straight down in the water a number of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus on a failed save.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you take a short rest.

### Sign of the Abyss
You can breath underwater and suffer no ill effects from water pressure. You gain darkvison out to 30 ft when underwater and can see clearly through the water up to that distance. You also gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed.

### Squamous Hide
The flesh on your arms, legs and body carries scattered patches of scales, slippery and fish-like. You have advantage on any checks you make to resist or escape a grapple, and resistance to cold damage.

When you take damage, except psychic damage, you may use your ***reaction*** to reduce the amount taken by your Intelligence modifier.

### Drown in the Depths
When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the Shadowsea. The creature disappears and hurtles through a subaquatic realm. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target does not have a swim speed or the ability to breathe water, it takes 10d10 cold or bludgeoning damage (your choice) as it is exposed to lightless, icy water or the crushing depths.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Dagon to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Pod Leader
    Your swimming speed increases by 10 ft. While in water, friendly creatures within 30 ft gain a swimming speed equal to their movement speed.

</div>

You have touched the boundary between life and death, nearly  slipped away into the cold clutches of death. Somehow you were kept from passing that boundary and returned to life. Whether it was a god or another being, it chose you to be in its service. Now your patron requires repayment for this mercy, and only the souls of others will do. Choose wisely, for all who cross your path are marked for collection. It is up to you to safeguard them from that dark plane or to send them there to take your place in the cold embrace of death.

#### Traits of the Gravebound
Warlocks who have walked the line between life and death and endured the trials of their patron are known as gravebound, as their fate is tied to the inevitable passage of the soul into the beyond. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating the warlock.

#### Traits

| 3 | Corpses twitch and shift while in your presence.
| 4 | You have a strange affinity for carrion birds.
| 5 | You are overly-eager to discuss death and decay.
| 6 | When you cast a spell, spectral forms can be seen hovering around you.
| 7 | You talk to corpses and expect a response.
| 8 | Your heart beats only a few times per minute.
| 9 | Your shadow sometimes whispers in the voices of the dead.
| 10 | You appear skeletal and decayed in moonlight.
| 11 | Your skin is always cool to the touch.

### Memory of Life
When you cast spells that are restricted to targeting humanoids, such as *charm person*, you may instead target undead creatures whose CR is equal to or less than half your level.

### Rejection of the Crypt
Your refusal to die has left a mark upon you that cannot be denied. You can add your Intelligence modifier to death saving throws, and you gain immunity to effects that would reduce your maximum hit points.

### Ghoulish Constitution
Your flesh is filled with the icy chill of the grave. When you are hit with a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to steal life’s precious warmth from your attacker. When you do so, you gain resistance to the damage dealt, and the attacker takes cold damage equal to your warlock level. If the attacker is reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. If you already have temporary hit points, increase those temporary hit points by this amount instead.

You can use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Keeper of Souls
Your gain a measure of control over the spirits that are much to late to their death. Whenever a hostile undead within 60 ft of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level.

In addition, you gain resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to effects that would kill you instantly without dealing damage.

### Reaper of Souls
You are as implacable as the specter of death itself. You no longer age and cannot be magically aged. You gain immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions. When you kill a creature, it cannot be raised as undead or resurrected unless you allow it

Additionally, as a ***bonus action*** you can unleash the touch of death onto nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 ft of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d8 + your Intelligence modifier. Undead that take this damage are turned until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this power, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Death to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ### Dance Macabre
    As an ***action***, you may target one undead creature you can see within 30 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours. An undead creature whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect. Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.

- #### Cold Touch of Death
    *The touch of Death is cold indeed, chilling the touched through both body and soul.*

    When you cast a cantrip that deals necrotic damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Creature of Carrion
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    You can choose a haunted crow as your familiar. If you do, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level. While you have this familiar, it recovers a single use of its Shriek action whenever either of you reduces a creature to 0 hit points, and the saving throw DC of this action equals your warlock spell save DC

- #### Eyes of the Lost
    As an ***action***, you can choose to perceive through the senses of an undead creature within 120 ft until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

- #### Ledger of the Deceased
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    Whenever a creature that you can see within 120 ft dies or you touch a corpse, you can choose to have their name be magically inscribed in your Book of Shadows. That creature’s corpse is always considered to be present and whole within your Book. If your Book of Shadows is destroyed, all the names within are lost.

- #### Rejuvenating Mercy
    *Prerequisite: 4th level*

    The next time you die, your patron brings you back to life in 1d10 hours. Once this happens, you must replace this eldritch invocation with another, and this invocation permanently disappears from the list available to you. If you were resurrected in some other fashion, this invocation remains.

- #### Scythe of the Lifetaker
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    You can create a two-handed weapon of polished bone and golden metal using your Pact of the Blade feature. This weapon deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. When you attack with this weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls. On a hit, you can cast *healing word* as a ***bonus action*** using a warlock spell slot.

- #### Whispers of the Grave
    *Often, the dead speak to you, whether you'd like them to or not.*

    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    You can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Gravebound warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Haunted Crow
    Carrion birds feeding on the dead sometimes wander to close to the realms of this patron. As familiar as they are with those on the border of life and death, spirits of the dead occasionally wander back in their grasp, infusing the carrion birds with sinister energies. Their eyes glow with an eerie light, their wings beat silently, and a trail of horrible shadow filled with the grasping hands of those the beast has consumed follows the bird with malevolent intent. They speak in the voices of dead relatives and take pride in their foul mockery of the living, yet often offer wise advice and dangerous secrets to those who have defied death.

If they fail, they are frightened for 1 minute. They can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-dispater">Dispater, Lord of Dis</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Infernal Bulwark
| 6th | Aura of Fortitude
| 10th | Hellish Warding
| 14th |Iron Flesh

</div>

Dispater is an archdevil and the Lord of the Iron City. He is Hell's greatest jailer and politician and rules its second layer, Dis. Also known as the Iron Lord, Father of Dis and First King, Dispater is one of the more active rulers of Hell and one of Asmodeus's closest and long standing allies. His unholy symbol is an iron spike driven into a golden ring with a red and purple crown.

Paranoid and reclusive, he no longer leaves his inner sanctum. He is always stoic, emotionless, and expressionless. He remains this way constantly even in the heat of battle. Dispater is the very definition of caution. He is vigilant beyond compare, weaving a web of impenetrable defenses around himself and his holdings. His plans are far-reaching, taking generations to come to fruition. Yet he is not a craven, frightened fiend who grasps at power out of fear of losing it. He is calm, composed, and charming. He is the perfect gentleman, not given to emotional outbursts or acts of passion. He knows the political games of the Nine Hells, and he's one of the best players. Dispater has a finger in everything. He has agents scattered throughout the layers, all working toward some convoluted scheme.

### Infernal Bulwark
Gain 2 skill points to spent on *Armor* combat skills.

### Aura of Fortitude
Any ally within 20 ft gains a +2 bonus to AC or saving throws (their choice). You do not gain this benefit. At level 14, the radius of this aura extends to 40 ft around you.

### Hellish Warding
You can concentrate on up to two abjuration spells at the same time. However, while you are concentrating on both of these spells, you may cast no additional spells, with the exception of cantrips. If you fail a concentration check, you lose both spells.

### Iron Flesh
You gain resistance one of the following damage types: piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning. Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed. This invulnerability can only be overcome by a weapon that is both magic and silver.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-emergentMind">The Emergent Mind</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Haunted, Silent Keeper
| 6th | Visions of Aeons
| 10th | Unspoken Guardian
| 14th |Spirit of Place

</div>

You have noticed — and been noticed by — an unfathomable intelligence that permeates a particular locality. Born from sites of strong emotions, tragedies, or even the complex interactions of unwitting participants, these entities whisper subtly of times forgotten through the creak of the floorboard, the din of the city market, the cavernous echo of dripping water, or the shining death of a distant star.

A typical example of these beings may be a sinister haunting, however these entities may also exhibit subtly protective behaviour over the domain they preside, or an innate desire for knowledge of the outside world they cannot walk.

#### Quirks
Warlocks that have signed a pact with an Emergent Mind are often very esoteric individuals, if they choose to reveal themselves at all. Immersing themselves in a world that others cannot see, they may be seen as eccentric, mad or downright spine chilling in their behaviour. These quirks are provided to inspire some odd behaviours in your Emergent Mind warlock.

#### Emergent Mind Warlock Quirks
| d12 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
|1| You often stare off into space, attempting to perceive something that may or may not be there.|
|2| You are obsessed with finding meaning in stars, comets and clouds.|
|3| You treat anything with a long history with religious reverence and respect.|
|4| Instead of nervous, you are excited and inquisitive of anything that goes bump in the night.|
|5| You tend to not enjoy the company of any one particular person but appreciate the bustle of society as a whole.|
|6| You have a deep appreciation of any local folklore, down to the most minute details, but scorn formally written historical records.|
|7| You naturally appear aloof to others and avoid contact unless you make an effort to present yourself.|
|8| You often have staring matches with furniture, waiting for them to make their first move.|
|9| Your silhouette shifts and changes when viewed from afar.
|10| People often see a brief glimpse of a figure looming behind you.
|11| You sometimes hear an entity speaking to you, between the words of others.
|12| Foreboding omens alway seem to occur whenever you say something of great portent or dire consequence.

### Haunted
Weird occurrences and events just happen all around you. You learn the *minor illusion* and *thaumaturgy* cantrips, and can cast them without any material, somatic, or verbal components. They do not count against your number of cantrips known.

### Silent Keeper
Your patron grants you the knowledge to remain out of sight and mind, as they have for aeons. Add *Stealth* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on it.

### Visions of Aeons
You can cause painful memories or visions of stories untold to flash before the mind of any creature that strikes you. When you take damage from another creature that you can see, you can force the target creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC as a reaction. On a failed save, the creature is both frightened and charmed condition by you until the end of their next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Unspoken Guardian
You become a timeless emissary for your patron, speaker for that which does not, and guardian of their secrets. For every 10 years that pass, you age only 1 year, and you cannot be magically aged.

In addition, creatures that attempt to speak your name or describe you in any way must succeed with a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, words escape them, and while they may remember you clearly, they cannot name, describe or draw you in any manner for 24 hours. On a successful save they are immune to this effect for 24 hours. You may designate any creature that you have met to be unaffected by this feature.

### Spirit of Place
You can merge with the local consciousness of reality until the start of your next turn as a ***bonus action***. You vanish, no longer occupying your current space and you gain truesight out to 300 ft, which ignores all forms of cover. All existing conditions and effects on you are suspended and you are immune to all damage for this duration. At the start of your next turn, you must choose an open space anywhere within this 300 ft radius to appear again.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Emergent Mind to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Affinity for the Dead
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the talisman, 5th level*

    Your control of the dead is unmatched. When you cast *speak with dead*, you understand the target, even if they do not share a language with you. The target is compelled to give you truthful answers.

    Additionally, you can cast *animate dead* once without using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Dance Macabre
    As an ***action***, you may target one undead creature you can see within 30 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours. An undead creature whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect. Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.

- #### Forgive and Forget
    *Prerequisites: 9th level*

    You can cast the *modify memory* spell at will without expending a spell slot, however the target creature must be unconscious or sleeping. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

- #### Haunting Blade
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Blade*

    You can summon your pact weapon as a ***bonus action*** instead of an action, and can choose to deal psychic damage with it instead the normal damage type, if you have advantage on your attack roll.

    If you score a hit against a surprised creature with your pact weapon you deal an additional 3d6 psychic damage, and their movement speed is halved until the end of their next turn.

- #### Memories of Days Past
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Tome, 11th level*

    While holding your Book of Shadows, you may perform a 10 minute ceremony allowing you to peer into the past. While concentrating, you may view any single previous event that has occured in the area within 60 feet in the last 100 years; you must state a date and a specific event occurring on that calendar day, or a precise amount of time before the present.

    All objects and creatures that were present at the specified time will appear as ghostly images only to you, playing the event that occurred until it is deemed finished (at the DM's discretion) in echoing sound. If the area or any particular creature in the area (both currently and at the desired time) is under an effect that prevents divination spells, such as nondetection, then this ghostly memory will fail to appear. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Spectral Guardian
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast *guardian of faith* once without expending a spell slot. When *guardian of faith* is cast in this way it appears as a large phantom and deals necrotic damage instead of radiant damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Voices in the Wall
    You can cast the *thaumaturgy* cantrip up to a range of 120 ft, and you can affect objects you can't see, so long as you have seen them before and can visualise their location.

    In addition, you can create up to three different effects with a single casting of this spell, and you can also extinguish a small non-magical light source such as torch or lamp for up to 1 minute as a chosen effect.

- #### Watcher's Gaze
    *Prerequisites: 15th level*

    Matter is of no consequence to sight and mind. When you touch a surface or object, such as a wall, floor or door, you may cause a 10 ft square area up to 5 ft thick to become transparent to yourself as a ***bonus action***. Creatures with *truesight* or under the effect of the *see invisibility* spell can also see this transparency. This effect remains as long as you keep touching the affected surface.

- #### Whispers of the Grave
    *Often, the dead speak to you, whether you'd like them to or not.*

    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    You can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot.

- #### World's Empathy
    The world appears differently to you than it does to others, you see existence as a personality unto itself. You gain the *Perception - Insight* skill and its prerequisite. When you would normally make an Investigation check to search an area, you may choose to perform an Insight check instead.

    In addition you are considered to have the *History* skill when making checks made to recall knowledge, if these checks are made in a location directly related to the topic being discussed.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Emergent Mind patron warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- ##### Mindspark
    The mindspark is a primordial spirit with a capacity for independent thought. Often mistaken for will-o'-wisps, these faintly glowing spirits exhibit no ill will towards other beings unless threatened or directed by their master, but are content with amusing themselves by possessing various objects, causing harmless pranks or minor scares.

    </td></tr>
    <tr><td><hr></td></tr>
    <tr><td markdown="1" class="monster">

    ### Actions
    ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, *Hit* 1d4 + 3 bludgeoning damage. The mindspark may only use this attack if it possesses an object that permits movement or has appropriate moving parts. This attack may change if the mindspark possesses a weapon, using that weapon's properties instead, however the attack and damage bonuses remain the same.

    ***Object Possession.*** The mindspark possesses an object of size Large or smaller, as long as it either unattended or being worn or carried by a willing creature. The mindspark can't move the object in this state unless it weighs 10 pounds or less.

    While in control of an object, the mindspark can manipulate any moving parts as a bonus action, including attempting to unlock the object with a Dexterity check. The mindspark is indistinguishable from a normal object until it moves and takes half of the damage of the object it is inhabiting.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-eternalCitadel">The Eternal Citadel</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Righteous Guardian
| 6th | Force of Preservation
| 10th | Builder of Walls
| 14th |Bound to the Aeons

</div>

You've made a pact with the Eternal Citadel, a massive yet empty bastion that seems to wander between worlds, collecting travelers and then releasing them again once they agree to serve. The Eternal Citadel communicates through the silent transferal of emotions and feelings - an instinctual sense to follow a course of action, no matter how enigmatic it may seem. An unknown number of people have sworn their allegiance to the Citadel, and few ever meet, but they all serve the same end, known or otherwise: preservation against the forces that seek destruction.

#### Preservation Without Regard
The Eternal Citadel is a force of protection and stasis, seeking to keep the world exactly as it is. However, once a new change has occurred and has become finalized, it will immediately shift course and seek to maintain the new status quo. One of the few things that it does not oppose in any way is the construction of architecture and the creation of permanent things that are designed to last for eternity. The subtle consciousness within the Citadel welcomes the creation of more eternal bastions, though few are ever so grand or so imposing, and none match it in power.

#### Defenders and Guardians
Those who have sworn themselves to the Eternal Citadel are not known for welcoming change and are often highly conflicted in their quests. They seek to end the forces of ruination, constantly working against powers of destruction and decay. Warlocks who follow the call of the Citadel are known for their patience and determination at seeking their goals. Many are known as grand architects, builders, and warriors, creating fortresses in mere days and dealing death to the ruinous powers from behind their new fortifications.

#### The Displeasure of the Silent
The Citadel does not speak, but communicates instead in pure sensations of desire and belief. The subtle consciousness of the place is not bound by the mortal constraint of time, but it does know that the minds of others are vulnerable to its passing. Warlocks who turn against the pact and shatter the deal are often the first to be granted what some call the Citadel’s darkest curse: false immortality.

Tales are told of individuals who grow old, feeble, and weak. Their minds suffer under the weight of eons, trapping them in a state of helpless confusion. Their bodies become thin and skeletal no matter how much they eat, and their breathing becomes slow and painful. Yet, no matter how agonized or miserable they are, they cannot die. The Citadel will not allow it. They must be preserved, for they have been marked by that shining and terrible fortress.

### Traits of the Timeless
Warlocks who have made a pact with the Eternal Citadel are often known as timeless, and are known for their strangeness and unusual habits, given many are stolen from other worlds. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after performing one of your duties as a servant of the Citadel.

#### Trait
| d10 | Trait |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You tend to assess doorways before walking through them. |
| 2 | You are hesitant to destroy any objects. |
| 3 | You are anxious when outdoors. |
| 4 | You talk to structures and expect an answer. |
| 5 | You often stroke stone as though it were a pet. |
| 6 | Your skin appears to be made of marble, in the right light. |
| 7 | Your skin is always cool to the touch. |
| 8 | Your skin tone slowly adapts to appear identical to any stone that you are touching while you are asleep.  |
| 9 | When you cast a spell, a soft halo of light forms around your body. |
| 10 | Your facial structure is oddly statuesque and your hair remains in a single shape, no matter how hard you try to change it. |

### Righteous Guardian
Gain the ability to shield yourself and others from harm. Whenever you or an ally within 30 ft takes damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to create a mystical barrier of energy. The amount of damage taken is reduced by half your warlock level + your Intelligence modifier, after applying resistances or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Force of Preservation
Gain the ability to fortify yourself further. Whenever you take damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to become immune to the damage from that effect or attack, and gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Builder of Walls
Your connection with the Eternal Citadel deepens, enabling you to call upon it for defense. You learn two spells with the word “wall” in their name that are of 5th level or lower. They do not count against your total spells known. You can’t choose *wall of force* as one of these spells.

You can cast one of these two spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Bound to the Aeons
Your oath to the Eternal Citadel becomes irrevocable. You no longer age, and cannot be magically aged. You also do not require food or water.

Additionally, you can call down an onslaught of timeless power from the central spire of the Citadel to burn away the souls of your foes. During your turn, you can use an ***action*** to choose a location that you can see within 200 ft. An infinitely tall 10 ft radius cylinder expands in that space, illuminating it with bright otherworldly light. At the start of your next turn, a beam of golden energy shoots down from the sky, and creatures within the area must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they take 7d6 radiant damage, 7d6 force damage, and are blinded until the start of your next turn. If they succeed, they take half as much damage and are not blinded. This beam passes through obstacles without damaging them.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Eternal Citadel to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Alliance Upheld
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    Whenever you use your Righteous Guardian feature on an ally who has at least 1 hit point, they regain hit points equal to your warlock level.

- #### Curse of the Citadel
    Your flesh grows corrupt in appearance, being more pale marble than mortal skin, but imbued with terrible might. While you are not wearing armor or using a shield, you can choose to have your AC equal 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. In addition, while active you can gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points at will as an ***action***.

- #### Grand Design
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome*

    You can focus your awareness on a structure you are touching for one minute (as if concentrating on a spell) to learn its floor plan. if the building is larger than a 100 ft cube, you only learn the floor plan for a 100 ft cube area of the building, centered on you.

    Additionally, you deal double damage to objects and structures. Once per turn when you deal damage to a construct, it takes an additional 1d8 force damage.

- #### Hammer of Dawn
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    You can create any bludgeoning weapon from worked stone infused with golden metal using your Pact of the Blade feature. At creation, you can choose to have this weapon deal force damage instead of bludgeoning damage. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. A target hit by this weapon cannot make opportunity attacks targeting creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

- #### Preserved Document
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    You are instantly aware of any attempt by the other parties to break the terms of any contract or written agreement signed by you. If the contract is broken, you become aware of it.

- #### Servants of the Citadel
    When you deal damage to a creature with a cantrip or weapon attack, you can use your ***bonus action*** to fortify an ally that you can see within 60 ft. The target gains temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier that lasts 1 minute.

- #### Steadfast Companion
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Eternal Citadel patron warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Animate Shield
    Animate shields are summoned from the long-silent forges of the Eternal Citadel, made long ago to defend the servants of the massive fortress from any invader. They rest silently when not addressed on in combat, but are always wary of attackers to the point of paranoia. Most are hesitant to leave the sight of their charge, and will only do so by direct order.

    They also seem to have a cutting sense of humor, mocking opponents and striking at their minds with subtle magics whenever they are attacked. They have a strange rivalry with other magical objects, especially magical weapons, which they view with disdain and distrust due to their opposing purpose. They are fond of gifts of art and masonry, and adore being painted and encrusted with gemstones when done as a show of ownership and affection.

The shield cannot be forcibly moved during this time. If the ally teleports, the shield also teleports with them.

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Cosmic Conduit
| 6th | Stardust Crusader
| 10th | Under the Night Sky
| 14th | Astrological Savant

</div>

Stars beyond measure populate the void beyond the world while celestial spheres circle above. You have met with one of their number, cast down by the many cold and unfeeling suns above for the sin of falling in love with a mortal. As punishment, the spiteful and envious stars shined their pale fury upon the paramour, destroying them utterly. The Exile now wanders the world it has been cast upon, appearing as a shimmer of light. Its goal is known only to those whom it trusts, and it grants power to them as it is powerless itself, stripped of interaction with the mortal world for its hubris.

It endlessly searches, seeking either a soul of great kindness to help it find the knowledge and power to resurrect its fallen paramour or one unscrupulous enough to wage war upon the very stars themselves. The light shines, but that fire can be cold and merciless, like the wrath of a love destroyed.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

#### The Elvish Legend of the Exile
*Once, there was a nameless star that hung above the world, shining among all its brothers and sisters. All of them spoke to one another and watched the universe, as they had since the beginning of time and in the countless eons since.*

*They performed their celestial dances with precision and inscrutability, circling and shifting without a single thought for the worlds that orbited them.*

*However, this star was not like the others. It looked upon the world we walk and saw that there was life. Intrigued, it crept every so slowly toward our world, watching our fleeting lives pass in mere moments to the timeless and cosmic being.*

*With great hope and sadness it watched as countless creatures rose and fell before it, and it became numb to the violent lives of lesser things, until one fateful moment.*

*A mortal, singing a song of all the things that make life so bittersweet caught the attention of this nameless star, and so with an effort of will it shifted ever closer and sought to hear.*

*The song had pulled it from the endless cycle of apathy that had grown within the heart of the star, and it began to care about the life of the mortal. It shined brightly in the nights and competed with the sun during the day. Its well wishes blessed the mortal with happiness and health.*

*Yet, all of this required the star to move from where it was intended to be in the celestial balance. The other stars were disrupted and cried out, spiteful and envious of the emotion a nameless one among their number could feel.*

</div>

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

*Their rage was made manifest, and the stars struck the place where the mortal lived with the hate of one thousand suns, utterly destroying the mortal. They then took their former sibling and cast them down from the heavens, to wander and beg for champions to bring it justice and peace.*

*So remember, children, do not follow the dancing lights that come wandering in the night. Those are the servants of the Exile, and the road they walk will only end in sorrow, either for themselves or for the world.*

</div>

When you cast from the space of an enemy, they take 1d6 radiant damage. When you cast from the space of an ally, they gain 1d6 temporary hit points.

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to warlocks of the Fallen, who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Luminous Shard
    The luminous shard is a small humanoid construct made from the crystallized starlight of the Fallen Exile’s tears that were shed when it witnessed the execution of its mortal love. These shards appear as small faceless statues that vaguely resemble the paramour, and are given as a reminder of the grim purpose that drives the servants of this fallen star.

    They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-fiend">The Fiend</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Dark One's Blessing
| 6th | Dark One's Own Luck
| 10th | Fiendish Resilience
| 14th | Hurl Through Hell

</div>

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

### Dark One's Blessing
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level.

### Dark One's Own Luck
You can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Fiendish Resilience
You can choose one damage type when you finish a long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

### Hurl Through Hell
When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Fiend to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Balefire
    *Prerequisites: 12th level*

    Your patron has bestowed upon you the ability to channel otherworldly flames from the deepest infernal pits. When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you treat creatures immune to fire as if they were only resistant to fire.

- #### Cloak of Flies
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    As a ***bonus action***, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies.The aura extends 5 ft from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you’re incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

    The aura grants you advantage on Intimidation checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.

- #### Otherworldly Leap
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    Your legs are longer than is normal for your race. Add a foot-and-a-half to your total height. Your height is visibly distinctive and may be physically disconcerting.

    You can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Unholy Brand
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Talisman feature*

    You can use an ***action*** to brand the creature holding your talisman with an unholy symbol. This dark mark is visible only to you and the affected creature, and remains even if the creature is no longer holding your talisman.

    Within the next 7 days, you can cast a single spell that targets or is centered on the branded creature, as long as they are on the same plane of existence, after which the effect ends and the mark fades. This effect will also end if you brand another creature, or if the remove curse spell is cast on the creature.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-greatOldOne">The Great Old One</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Awakened Mind
| 6th | Visions of Horror
| 10th | Labyrinthine Conundrum
| 14th |Create Thrall

</div>

Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, That Which Lurks, Tharizdun the Chained God, Dendar the Night Serpent, Zargon the Returner, Great Cthulhu and other unfathomable beings.

### Awakened Mind
Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 ft. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Visions of Horror
You can flood the minds of those who assault you with terrifying, incomprehensible images from your patron's realm. When a creature within 60 ft damages you, you can use your ***reaction*** to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.

On a failed save, the creature takes psychic damage equal to 1d10 + half your warlock level and is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Labyrinthine Conundrum
The outer layers of your mind become alien in scope - becoming indecipherable to those who would plunder it, while revealing the true nature of the world around you. You are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts, or determine you are lying, unless you allow it.

Additionally, you can use your ***action*** to open your mind to the truth of the world. For 10 minutes, you gain truesight out to 60 ft. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Create Thrall
You gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your ***action*** to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is charmed by you until a ***remove curse*** spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The charmed creature regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the creature isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Great Old One to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Aberrant Metamorphosis
    *Otherworldly magic touches your familiar.*

    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Chain*

    Your familiar gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level, its creature type becomes aberration, and you can use your ***bonus action*** to make its appearance alien, or revert it to normal.

    While your familiar appears alien, it has advantage on Intimidation checks, and you can use your ***action*** to make it do something unnatural, such as gibber in maddening voices. A creature within 10 ft of the familiar that sees this must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of the familiar for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    Once you've made your familiar this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Agonizing Incantation
    *The whispers of your patron are always gnawing at your mind. You temporarily get some respite when sharing the words. It's not your fault that people can not handle it.*

    When you cast *ruin*, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Otherworldly Leap
    *Your legs are longer than is normal for your race. Add a foot or a foot-and-a-half to your total height. Your height is visibly distinctive, and may be physically disconcerting.*

    You can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Touch of Tharizdun
    *Your pact weapon becomes capable of carving through both flesh and mind.*

    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Blade*

    Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can cause the attack to deal psychic damage instead of its regular type. If you do so, the creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

    In addition you can choose to glimpse into its mind. You immediately learn if the creature is under any mind influencing effects and what those effects are, as well as learning the creature's greatest fears and desires. Once you glimpse a creature's mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Unfathomable Understanding
    *Your Book of Shadows becomes linked to an aspect of your patron you can call upon for knowledge, at the risk of your sanity.*

    *Prerequisites: 9th level, Pact of the Tome*

    You can cast *contact other plane* as a ritual. The aspect writes its answers in your Book of Shadows, in an arcane script only you can understand. The first time you fail your saving throw against the spell each day, you become insane for 1 minute instead of until the end of a long rest.

    Additionally, you can unerringly recall any information written in your Book of Shadows.

- #### Voice of Ulban
    *Your ability to touch the minds of other creatures expands dramatically.*

    When you use your Awakened Mind feature to communicate telepathically, the range increases to 120 ft, you can communicate with a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier simultaneously, and other creatures can respond to your telepathic messages, but can't initiate or terminate contact.

- #### Whispers Beyond the Veil
    *You can draw your consciousness close to the veil between worlds, listening to whispers from the denizens of the Far Realm.*

    *Prerequisites: 3rd level*

    You can cast *augury* without expending a spell slot and without material components. When cast this way, you can gain advantage on one attack roll or ability check of your choice that you make in the next hour, if it relates to the course of action you received an omen for.

    Once you cast *augury* this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-serpentEmpress">Hesperia, The Serpent Empress </a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Blessing of the Empress
| 6th | Hair of Snakes
| 10th | Toxic Blood
| 14th |Gaze of the Goddess

</div>

Situated within her palace of gold and turquoise, the Serpent Empress sleeps in serene silence, guiding her slaves about their secret business. Envious and vain, the Empress personifies greed and avarice in the hearts of man. Jealousy, spite, and simple pride have driven her servants to her side. She whispers in a sibilant voice, speaking of wealth and power promised but so rarely delivered. The sins she offers are subtle at first, but grow in style and salaciousness with every slow cycle of the hourglass. You've assigned yourself to her service, and sworn fealty to the Serpent Empress in exchange for a sliver of her supreme strength.

#### Traits of the Imperial Courtier
Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after serving the in schemes of the Empress.

#### Traits
| d8 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You speak with sibilant syllables. |
| 2 | You insist on eating your food raw. |
| 3 | Your irises are shaped like those of a snake. |
| 4 | Your blood is dark green or black. |
| 5 | Your teeth become fanged and sharp. |
| 6 | When you cast a spell, your eyes glow with a colorful radiance, and shimmering scales cover your skin. |
| 7 | You frequently wear snakes upon your body. |
| 8 | You have a tendency to not blink. |

### Blessing of the Empress
You receive the favor of your patron. You gain advantage on saving throws against poison and effects that inflict the poisoned condition. You can speak to snakes, serpents, and other reptiles as though you were under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell.

Whenever you cast a spell that has a verbal component, you can suppress the senses of those around you. Choose one creature within 30 ft that can hear you. Your spellcasting is silent to that creature, and it has disadvantage on its next Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma check within 1 minute.

### Hair of Snakes
You can cause a swarm of serpents to grow from your head as a ***bonus action*** and they remain until you dismiss them. While they are out, you can see through the eyes of these serpents. As long as the serpents can see, you have advantage on Perception checks, gain low-light vision out to 30 ft and gain immunity to the blinded condition.

While within 10 ft of a creature, you can use your ***action*** to have your serpents whisper a sinful secret to the creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If it fails, it gains the charmed condition until the end of your next turn or until it takes damage.

### Toxic Blood
Your veins run with venom. You gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. Additionally, poison damage you deal treats immunity to poison as resistance to poison. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are considered to be not immune, but they do have advantage on any saving throw against the poison.

### Gaze of the Goddess
Your patron looks from your eyes and exerts her supreme power through you. As an ***action*** choose one creature within 30 ft. The target is paralyzed for one minute. If the target takes damage, the effect ends. If the target is immune to paralysis, it takes 3d10 psychic damage and is knocked prone.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Hesperia to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Agonizing Poison
    *The poison of your patron is more potent than any mundane poison.*

    When you cast a cantrip that deals poison damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Cold Blooded
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast *polymorph* once without expending a spell slot, but only to turn the target into a snake or other reptile. Once you do, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Handmaiden's Friend
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    When you have an imperial cobra as your familiar, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level. While your familiar is within 10 ft of you, it can use its ***reaction*** to make an attack whenever you take damage.

- #### Majestic Scales
    *Prerequisite: 6th level*

    When you aren’t wearing armor or a shield, you can choose to have your AC equal 10 + your Intelligence modifier + your Dexterity modifier. While you do so, as a ***bonus action*** your hair serpents can deliver melee spell attacks with a reach of 10 feet. If the attack hits, the serpents deal poison damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.

- #### Ophidian Fang
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    You can create a golden weapon from the fang of a giant serpent that deals piercing or slashing damage using your Pact of the Blade feature. You can choose to have this weapon deal poison damage. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can use your ***bonus action*** to take the Disengage action. Once do you so, you can’t do so again until you inflict the poisoned condition on an enemy or you finish a short rest. Critical hits with this weapon poison the target until the end of your next turn.

- #### Slaves of the Empress
    *Prerequisite: 12th level*

    You can cast *giant insect* without expending a spell slot, except you can only target snakes. You can create up to two giant constrictor snakes or six giant poisonous snakes. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Venomous Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to emit a puff of gas from your pact shield, dealing poison damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Serpent Empress patron warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Imperial Cobra
    The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious.

    Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.

    Most servants of the Empress will offer the imperial cobra some form of identifying jewelry, so that it may more clearly express its superiority over all lesser creatures. It serves its master as an equal, subservient only to their wishes by the fact of the magic binding them rather than any true loyalty. The oath of a snake means little, except when it is made to the ruler of the Endless Empire.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-hive">The Hive</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Children of the Swarm
| 6th | Gnashing Swarm
| 10th | Hive Mind
| 14th |One of Many

</div>

Through circumstances desperate or sinister, you have found yourself sworn into the service of the swarms of a hivemind or perhaps an alien entity that presides over them. Through your benefactor's guidance, you have learned to weave the discordant voices of thousands into the will of one mind, and use this power to sow chaos in your wake on the battlefield.

The intentions of these cunning and enigmatic yet bestial beings are incredibly difficult to glean, even for one with such a unique bond as yourself. Their directives may range from instinctual to frighteningly intelligent; their motives unfathomably deep or horrifyingly base.

### Quirks
Warlocks of a Hive patron are often regarded as frightening individuals who spend much of their time living amongst creatures others would consider vermin. This stigma is often well justified, as they commonly exhibit disturbing behaviours imparted by the influence of the hive.

| d6 | Quirk |
|:--:|:------|
| 1 | Every now and then, a bug will fly out of your mouth while you are talking. This is perfectly normal.
| 2 | You tend to attract insects regardless of your state of hygiene.
| 3 | If one looks closely, the surface of your eyes appear segmented.
| 4 | Your skin is covered in stings, bite marks and scars.
| 5 | You often find yourself distracted, observing the behaviour of insects.
| 6 | You are disappointed that you don't find rotting meat palatable, as it smells delightful.

### Children of the Swarm
You can summon the young of your hive to feed on your fallen enemies. When you slay a creature, you can cause a ravenous cloud of insects to erupt from its body as a ***reaction***. Any hostile creature that begins their turn or moves adjacent to the target corpse suffers magical piercing damage equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your warlock level.

The swarm will disperse after 1 minute, or if the target corpse is destroyed, revived, raised  or if you use this feature again on another slain creature. This feature can't be used on any creature that is not made of organic matter, such as constructs and elementals.

### Gnashing Swarm
You can send out the swarm to harry your foes. As an ***action***, your swarm appears as a 10 ft radius cloud within 60 ft of you. The swarm remains for 1 minute, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. If an enemy creature enters the swarm the first time on a turn or starts it's turn in it, it takes 3d4 piercing damage. Creatures that are reduced to 0 hit points from this damage are affected by Children of the Swarm.

As a ***bonus action***, you can move the center of the swarm 20 ft. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect. You can't use this ability until you complete a long rest.

### Hive Mind
You and your swarm's consciousness have melded together, for better or worse. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance against poison and psychic damage.

Additionally, if you make a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can choose to automatically succeed instead of rolling. You regain this feature after a short rest.

### One of Many
You can discorporate into a swarm as a ***bonus action***. You can spend up to 1 minute in this form however the time spent does not need to be contiguous. You regain all expended time in this form when you finish a long rest. This effect is similar to the gaseous form spell except it does not require concentration or components, your flight speed is 60 feet, and you can freely discard this form without using an action.

You can also choose to unleash a second massive swarm as an ***action*** when you discard this form. Every hostile creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed saving throw a creature suffers 4d10 magical piercing damage and takes half damage on a success.

This area is considered difficult terrain and heavily obscured only for hostile creatures until the end of your next turn. Once you use this second swarm, you can't do so again until you have finished a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations have been added as additions for the Hive patron.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Crawling Chorus
    You can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt when you cast *conjure insects* and its range is doubled. In addition, you can move a creature up to 10 feet when they fail their saving throw against this spell.

- #### Companion Swarm
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    When you summon your familiar, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special swarms: Swarm of Insects, Spiders, Centipedes, Beetles or Wasps.

- #### Corpsejackers
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    You can infest a dead body with a part of your swarm. You can revive the corpse of a humanoid, beast or monstrosity of CR 1 or lower. It is under your control for 24 hours after which it permanently dies, consumed from within. That creature cannot be revived again. You can't use this again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Million Whispers
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature, 9th level*

    You can perform a 10 minute ritual while holding your Book of Shadows to commune with all insects within 3 miles. This effect is similar to the *commune with nature* spell, however a group of insects will also lead you along the shortest path to one location of your choice, and you gain advantage on Perception and Survival checks while you remain within 30 ft of this guiding insect swarm.

</div>





<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-jubilex">Jubilex, the Formless One </a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Amorphous Step, Recovered Memories
| 6th | Side Splitting
| 10th | Acidic Body
| 14th |Cellular Division

</div>

The demon lord of poison and ooze. Of all the demon lords, Jubilex is perhaps the one least concerned with maintaining a cult, it's debatable whether Jubilex even realizes he has worshipers. Certainly, those who worship him tend not to think of him as an entity to be venerated as much as a source of power. Yet despite the Faceless Lord's passing disinterest in his faithful, he certainly knows of the Material Plane and enjoys absorbing the bodies of unwilling mortals into his protoplasmic bulk.

You have formed a symbiotic relationship with your patron, by integrating a portion of your patron's slimy body within you, which in turn grants you supernatural power that you now wield. Slowly but surely, you are becoming one with your patron, but not before you channel its power for your great ambitions.

### Quirks
The power of Jubilex touches more than just the soul. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock.

| d8 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You track footprints of slime wherever you go while outdoors. You can suppress this when you notice it.
| 2 | Your blood slowly becomes slime when exposed to air.
| 3 | You have a strange fondness for gelatin.
| 4 | Your heart feels like it wanders around in your chest.
| 5 | You tend to wiggle in an unnatural manner.
| 6 | You sometimes confuse people for corpses you’ve consumed.
| 7 | You appear wet and sticky.
| 8 | Your eyes are acid green with purple flecks.

### Amorphous Step
Your form becomes more flexible and fluid. You can move through a space as narrow as a foot wide without squeezing, and you have resistance to falling damage.

### Recovered Memories
You learn to dissolve the bodies of the dead and learn from their lives. As an ***action*** while standing adjacent to a corpse, you can produce an iridescent acid that consumes the corpse over the course of 1 minute. Once the process has finished, you can reabsorb the acid to access the creature’s memories. You gain information about the creature’s last 48 hours alive and the most important memories from their final year of life.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Side Splitting
Your body becomes somewhat... slimy. Whenever you suffer damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to divide into a Medium swarm of Tiny oozes, gaining resistance to damage from the attack.

Your hit points remain the same, and you function as a single unified swarm that occupies the same space as a Medium creature. While in this state, you can’t take actions other than the Dash action, your movement speed is halved, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, you gain immunity to acid and poison damage, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks, and you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. You can return to your normal form at will without using an action, provided there is room to do so.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature at will as an ***action***. Using this feature as a reaction is still limited to once per long rest.

### Acidic Body
You are able to absorb some of the impact from physical blows and acid due to your acidic, gelatinous nature. You gain resistance to acid damage and nonmagical bludgeoning damage.

Additionally, whenever a creature starts its turn in a grapple with you, you can choose to have it take 2d8 acid damage.

### Cellular Division
When you are hit by an attack you can choose to split your form in two. The two resulting forms are considered a size smaller than your normal size and each have hit points equal to half your amount when you spilt. On each of your turns, you can choose to use your movement and action with either one of the two forms, but not both.

After 1 minute, if the two forms move more than 60 feet from each other, or until one of the forms drops to 0 hit points, the two forms merge back into your normal self with your hit points equal to the current hit points of the two individual forms added together.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Jubilex to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Caustic Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to emit a spray of acid from your pact shield, dealing acid damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

- #### Dissolving Touch
    You may cast *acid splash* as a melee spell attack instead of allowing the target a Dexterity save. If you do, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals, and the creature's AC is reduced by 1 for a minute, with a maximum reduction equal to your Intelligence modifier.

- #### Jiggly Defense
    *Prerequisite: 11th level, Pact of the Blade*

    When you would take damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks until the start of your turn.

- #### Slime Coating
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade, 5th level*

    Your pact weapon becomes coated in caustic slime. Once per turn, when you make a successful attack with your pact weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 acid damage.

- #### Unusual Form
    Whenever you would be subject to a critical hit, roll a d6. If the result is 4-6, the attack is not a critical hit. Additionally, you gain resistance to poison damage.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to warlocks of the Formless One, who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Slime Puddle
    The slime puddle is a small, amorphous, semi-transparent ooze that gently dissolves a little of everything it touches in a quest to experience all the flavors of the multiverse. They’re surprisingly expressive for a simple blob of slime, and often bounce and jiggle to express their feelings on a topic. They enjoy consuming corpses and other dead organic material, as they learn more and more about the universe with each meal.

    When threatened, the puddle will resort to violence with an intimidating glee. Against foes smaller than itself, the cube will rush them and attempt to engulf and consume them. They speak to the minds around them with a childlike innocence even as they feast on dead mortals and beasts alike. When at rest, the cube will seek a stone surface to rest upon, and will wobble slowly back and forth in a pattern seemingly designed to entice the unwary into touching it.

    ***Pseudopod***. *Melee Attack*: +2 to hit. *Hit*: 1d6+2 acid damage.

    ***Engulf.*** The puddle moves up to its speed. While it does so, it can enter the spaces of other creatures. Whenever the puddle enters the space of a hostile creature, and the creature is of the same size or smaller than the puddle, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. If it succeeds, it can choose to be pushed 5 ft back or to the side of the puddle. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

    On a failed save, the puddle enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 1d8 acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 3d8 acid damage at the start of each of the puddle’s turns.

    When the puddle moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes.

    Creatures inside the puddle can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 ft of the puddle can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the puddle. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 1d8 acid damage. The puddle can only hold one creature equal to its size, or four creatures of one size or more smaller than itself.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-keeperDepths">The Keeper of the Depths</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Secrets of the Lost, The Depths of Knowledge
| 6th | Sailor’s Nightmare
| 10th | Madness of the Deep
| 14th |Hunger for Knowledge

</div>

There are ancient things that dwell within the darkness of the ocean, watching those who live upon the surface of the world with curiosity and envy. Among them, there is a creature known as the Keeper of the Depths – a hulking tentacled crustacean of great wisdom and greater madness that stares into the night sky with greed, for the light of the sun is painful to its sensitive eyes. Thus, it waits for a time when thunderstorms and squalls drench the shores and cloud the skies to emerge, ever hungry for the secrets once thought lost.

#### An Accumulation of Ages
The Keeper is a jealous lord, ever vigilant for another prize. Ships carrying artifacts and treasures often draw its attention, as it will invade the dreams of the captain and crew to drive them into its clutches. The beast calls forth storms and rise from its home, grasping the ship and dragging it down into the deep to add to its collection. Its lair is littered with countless shipwrecks and ruins of civilizations long lost to time, and it decorates itself with the weapons of those sent to slay it and the treasures they sought to protect.

The Keeper uses magic to preserve the objects that cannot bear the terrible pressure of the ocean depths and places the pieces of its collection that are still living in suspended animation, keeping them alive and aware of their surroundings even as they are trapped and unable to act, blinded by the dark. The horror of this is beyond description, driving even stalwart souls mad.

#### Harvester of Dreams
Those who survive but are not worthy of collection are marked by the Keeper, who entraps them in servitude by forcing them to relive death after terrible death in their dreams, only relenting when they agree to serve. It erases the memories of the torments they have suffered, sealing them behind an accursed black mark hidden upon one’s soul. Nevertheless, it will continue to seek out these unfortunate chosen in their sleeping hours, taking knowledge from their minds in exchange for information relating to the goals it wishes them to pursue.

#### Dreams of the Deep
The Keeper’s reach is more than a mere invasion. Once the Keeper discovers something interesting in one, it will begin to dig, burrowing into the consciousness of the unfortunate victim. Tentacles of unearthly energy pour forth from its dream self into the surrounding ego, changing and twisting existing memories as it extracts what it desires.

Those who have experienced it describe it as being like suffering an injury and finding out that one’s bones are actually endless teeth stacked one atop another, merged into the shape that they should be but completely wrong nevertheless. Such is the horror that the Keeper inflicts, and yet some still go to it in supplication, for there is power in the twisting marks it makes upon ones soul.

#### Traits of the Dweller
The Keeper takes more than just restful sleep; it steals humanity and one’s own sense of self as well. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after serving the goals of the Keeper of the Depths.

| d8 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You sometimes talk in your sleep, whispering terrible secrets about things unknown to you.
| 2 | You appear oddly wet at all times, even when dry.
| 3 | Your skin becomes rubbery and cold.
| 4 | Your heartbeat can’t be felt, only heard.
| 5 | Your blood slowly becomes saltwater when exposed to air and smells like dead fish.
| 6 | A scent of ocean air seems to follow you.
| 7 | When you cast a spell, dark tentacles seem to reach up from under your skin before disappearing.
| 8 | You sometimes ask personal questions instead of offering greetings.

#### The Pact
You’ve made a pact with an ancient oceanic entity known as the Keeper of the Depths. As life teems within the seas, so do the secrets of the forgotten ages – sunken cities, ships lost at sea, and treasures unimaginable gone to the darkest currents that churn with horrible tentacles and creatures from nightmare. The Keeper watches over all this hidden knowledge, and harvests ever more in its endless pursuit of the unspoken secrets of the universe. In the deepest crevices where sunlight has never been seen, all oceans are one to the Keeper of the Depths, and its desire is insatiable.

### Secrets of the Lost
Your patron visits you in your dreams, stealing fragments of your experiences in exchange for hidden knowledge. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain 2 skills points to spend on non-combat skills. You have these skills until you finish another long rest.

### The Depths of Knowledge
You can perform a 10 minute ritual to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are on the ocean or underwater): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creature's' location or number.

### Sailor’s Nightmare
You can curse your enemies, using the weight of ethereal water to drag them into the sea’s embrace. As a ***bonus action***, you can curse a creature within 60 ft for 1 minute. While the creature is afflicted by this curse, it cannot jump or fly, and it treats all terrain as difficult terrain. If the creature is flying or swimming, at the start of each of its turns it must succeed at a Strength saving throw or descend 60 ft.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

### Madness of the Deep
The Keeper’s gaze looms over you. Whenever you take damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to unleash a wave of black ink to cloud the air in a 10 ft radius of your current location for one minute, heavily obscuring the area. Hostile creatures that end their turn within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they are frightened until the start of your next turn and must attempt to escape the cloud.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Hunger for Knowledge
You can summon the terrible maw of the Keeper to appear before you as an ***action***. A massive beak surrounded by tentacles appears and attempts to grab a target of your choice within 30 ft. When a creature is targeted, it must make a Strength saving throw against your warlock spell save DC to shake off the grasp of the horror. If the target fails, it is dragged into the beak and bitten, taking 6d10 piercing damage and 6d10 psychic damage. If this is enough to reduce the target to 0 hit points, you can choose to have them be swallowed whole by the mouth, consuming them. Either way, the maw then immediately disappears.

Once you summon this maw, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

If the maw consumes a creature using this feature, your patron visits you in your dreams during your next long rest and grants you a boon in return for the sacrifice. Choose any spell of 5th level or lower from the warlock or wizard spell lists. You can cast this spell twice using a warlock spell slot, after which it is lost. The spell is also lost if you sacrifice a new creature and select a new spell using this feature.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Keeper of the deep to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Gift of the Depths
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You can also cast *water breathing* without expending a spell slot. Once you cast it using this invocation, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Paper Boat
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    Your book of shadows becomes filled with sea charts and navigational maps. You gain the *Astronomy - Navigation* skill and its prerequisite and your Book of Shadows is able to act as navigation tools. You can not become lost as long as you have your Book of Shadows.

    By performing a 1 minute ritual with your Book of Shadows, you can transform it into a paper boat large enough to carry one Medium creature or object. The boat is impervious to water and damage, but lacks any means of propulsion. The boat can hold up to 500 pounds, instantly turning back into a book if more weight is placed onto it. You can transform the boat back into a book through the same ritual.

- #### Pod Leader
    Your swimming speed increases by 10 ft. While in water, friendly creatures within 30 feet of you gain a swimming speed equal to their movement speed.

- #### Sea Serpent
    *Prerequisites: Pact of the Chain feature*

    In addition to the other familiar options presented by the Pact of the Chain, you may choose to conjure a young sea drake as your familiar. A sea drake is a long, lithe, finned serpent that is naturally at home amongst the waves and sky. The statistics for the young sea drake are included here.

- #### Sirensong
    *Prerequisites: 5th level*

    As a ***bonus action***, you can usher forth an unearthly song that seems to come from all directions. Any creatures within 30 ft of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If a creature fails this saving throw, it gains the charmed condition until the end of your next turn. When you charm a creature with this ability, you may choose to move it up to 20 ft in a straight line closer to you.

    Once you use this ability, you require a short rest before you may use it again.

***Marine Camouflage.*** The drake shifts the color of its scales to blend into its environment until it attacks or uses its Torrent Breath, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Until then, it and any creature it is riding have advantage on Stealth checks made to hide.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-levistus">Levistus, Lord of Stygia</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Bladereaver
| 6th | One With The Blizzard
| 10th | Duelist
| 14th | Spell Parry

</div>

Levistus, Lord of the Fifth, is the imprisoned devil prince who rules Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells. Mountains of dark ice tower over the frozen sea of Stygia. At its center, a quarter-mile deep, rests Prince Levistus. He works through influence and avatars, unable to move in his possibly-eternal ice prison.

Charming, bold, and ruthlessly ambitious, Levistus remains confident and courageous, despite his imprisonment in ice. He is a rake and a bounder, espousing the eternal truth of betrayal, of how it is inevitable that all creatures violate whatever trust is put in them.

Levistus followers are thugs, rogues, and swashbuckling bravos generally in pursuit of some great betrayal or act of vengeance.

### Bladereaver
Once per turn, when you deal damage with a finesse weapon, add 1d8 cold damage. If you are wielding a rapier, you add 1d8 + your Intelligence instead.

### One With The Blizzard
Gain resistance to cold damage and your movement speed increases by 5 ft. Additionally, any spell you cast that would normally deal fire damage now does cold damage instead. Furthermore, your movement is not slowed in rough terrain caused by snow or ice.

### Duelist
Gain 3 superiority and have access to the Parry and Riposte martial maneuvers described in the Fighter class description.

### Spell Parry
If you are wielding a magic weapon, as a ***reaction*** you can reflect a spell cast at you back onto it's caster, if you are the single target. Use the spell's original spell attack modifier or spell save DC against the caster, as appropriate.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Levistus to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Agonizing Chill
    *You channel the chill of the frozen sea of Stygia through your magic.*

    When you cast a cantrip that deals cold damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage it deals.

- #### Chilling Blade
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    Whenever you summon your pact blade, you may choose for it to deal cold damage instead of its normal damage type.

- #### Chilling Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to emit a wave of chilling cold from your pact shield, dealing cold damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

- #### Tomb of Levistus
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the damage, you gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts.

    Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-monstrosity">The Monstrosity</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Destructive Potential
| 6th | Monstrous Roar
| 10th | Unstoppable Rage
| 14th |Spawn of the Monstrosity

</div>

Far away from the domains of mortals, out past the borders where civilization gives way to the great unknown, there dwell monsters titanic and unimaginable. Each of these mighty creatures, whatever they might be, have the power within them to end an empire and leave only rubble and ashes in their wake. Forgotten by most, these colossal beasts live on in fables and legends of the dark times when they ruled all the land, and mortals were as insects before them.

But some still remember their apocalyptic might. Few mortals, though others would think them mad or foolish, seek to master the cataclysmic potential of these creatures. Often this takes the form of drinking a specially enchanted tincture of the creature’s blood, infusing oneself with the creature’s magical energy, or consuming one of its eggs or offspring. The rush of power these mortals wield can be immense and overwhelming, both to themselves and others, and many lose themselves in their quest to take on the mantle of monstrosities that would give even the gods pause.

This power can be obtained from entities such as the tarrasque, a neothelid, a ha-naga, a behemoth or gargantuan creature (such as a gorilla, reptile, moth or similar), or Dendar the Night Serpent.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The spawn makes two attacks, which may be bite, claw, or tail attacks in any combination. It may substitute a use of its Frightful Presence for one of these attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack*: +12 to hit. *On hit*: 3d12 + 5 piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the spawn can't bite another target.

***Claw.*** *Melee Attack*: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. *On hit*: 3d8 + 5 slashing or bludgeoning damage (your choice).

***Tail.*** *Melee Attack*: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. *On hit*: 2d8 + 5 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each hostile creature within 60 feet, and aware of the spawn, must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the monstrosity spawn is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the spawn's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

#### Monstrous Mark
Warlocks that tread this path almost always carry some mark of the power they have taken into themselves. Decide with your DM how this mark manifests, or roll on the Monstrous Mark table.

| d8 | Mark |
|:--:|:-----|
| 1 | Your head has long, curled horns that end in spikes. |
| 2 | Your teeth are sharpened and serrated, like a shark’s. |
| 3 | Your eyes have vertical irises in an all-green sclera. |
| 4 | The bones in your arms and legs are too long, and you stoop when you walk. |
| 5 | You are exceptionally quick to anger, and snarl when you talk. |
| 6 | Your skin is rough, coated in scales or leathery warts. |
| 7 | You always feel hungry for exceptionally raw meat. |
| 8 | You unthinkingly, deliberately destroy objects. |

### Destructive Potential
You carry the destructive power of your patron within all that you do. Any of your spells or attacks deal double damage to structures and objects that are not worn or carried by a creature.

### Monstrous Roar
You can release the primal fury of your patron in a single, terrifying roar. As a ***bonus action*** or as a ***reaction*** when you are the target of an attack, you may bellow out a horrifying roar that rattles your opponents.

Any hostile creatures within 30 ft that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails this saving throw is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

If you used this ability as a ***reaction*** and the creature that targeted you fails its save, that condition confers disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.

After you use this ability, you must complete a short rest before you may use it again.

### Unstoppable Rage
The rage of your patron pushes you onward, making you an unstoppable force of destruction. When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you may use your ***reaction*** to regain a number of hit points equal to your warlock level.

After you use this ability, you must complete a short rest before you may use it again.

### Spawn of the Monstrosity
You can allow the might and fury of your patron to overwhelm your physical form, causing a transformation into a gigantic monster in their likeness.

You can use an ***action*** on your turn to undergo the transformation, which lasts for one minute, until you end it with another action, or until your new form reaches 0 hit points. For the duration, you replace all of your statistics with those of a monstrosity spawn, listed here. You are unable to speak or cast spells while in this form.

When you transform, choose whether any equipment and items you are holding or wearing become a part of this new form (vanishing from view), or drop to the ground at your feet. If you are in an area that is not big enough to contain your new form and that would not be immediately destroyed as a result of your transformation, this ability fails to function, expending the action you used, but not your usage of this ability.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

### Monstrous Variations
The colossal monstrosities that threaten the world are as varied as they are frightening, and have at their disposal many different methods of destruction. The monstrosity spawn presented here is intended to be a neutral mid-point between many various monstrosity patrons, and can be potentially modified (with your DM’s permission) to better represent your individual patron, using the following options. Once you decide upon the features of your monstrosity spawn form, you may not change them at a later time.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Climbing
    If your patron would have a climbing speed, your monstrosity spawn form may also gain a climbing speed equal to your normal movement speed. Doing so requires giving up one attack out of either your bite, claw, or tail attack. As an example, a behemoth gorilla patron could have a climbing speed, but would lack a tail attack.

- #### Flying
    If your patron possesses a flying speed, you may similarly take on a flying speed of 60 ft when you transform into a monstrosity spawn. Doing so requires giving up your Magic Resistance.

- #### Psionics
    Few potential patrons, such as a neothelid, have the ability to utilize limited psionic magic. If your monstrosity spawn form takes on this property, it must give up two attacks out of either your bite, claw, or tail attacks. Doing so allows you to cast the *confusion* and *telekinesis* spells once each while you are within your monstrosity spawn form, without expending spell slots or material components.

    If you are concentrating on either of these spells when your monstrosity spawn form ends, that spell ends automatically.

- #### Ray
    Some patrons, often those that fly, can perform a ranged attack that batters creatures with a concentrated ray of sound or magical force. This attack replaces two attacks out of either your bite, claw, or tail attacks, and may be used as part of your form’s multiattack.

    Your ray attack is a ranged attack made against one target within a range of 120 ft, with +12 to hit. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force or thunder damage (your choice).

- #### Stinger
    Many insectoid or worm patrons come equipped with a large venomous stinger. If your monstrosity form has a stinger, you may gain a stinger attack that replaces two attacks out of either your bite, claw, or tail attack, and may be used as a part of your form’s multiattack.

    Your stinger attack is a melee attack made against one target with +12 to hit. On a hit, the target takes 1d10+5 piercing damage and 2d10 poison damage, and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 18 or become poisoned for 1 minute.

- #### Tentacles
    Some particularly horrifying patrons have tentacles. If you emulate their tentacles in your monstrosity spawn form, replace one attack out of either your bite, claw, or tail attack with a tentacle attack, which may be made as part of your form’s multiattack.

    This tentacle attack is a melee attack made against one target with a reach of 15 ft, with +12 to hit. On a hit, the target takes 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage and, if it is a creature, becomes grappled by you  (escape DC 18).

</div>


### Patron Invocations
The following invocations can be chosen by warlocks with the Monstrosity patron.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Long Stride
    *Your legs are longer than is normal for your race. Add a foot or a foot-and-a-half to your total height. Your height is visibly distinctive, and may be physically disconcerting.*

    You can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Monstrous Familiar
    *Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Chain feature*

    Using an action when your familiar is present, you may enlarge it to medium size for up to one minute, causing it to gain additional maximum hit points equal to twice your warlock level for the duration.

    While it is enlarged in this way, you may allow your familiar to attack by expending a ***bonus action***. All your familiar’s attacks deal 1d6 extra damage and the DCs of any saves imposed by your familiar also increase to 8 + half your warlock level, if this would be higher than the listed DC.

    You may return your familiar to its original size by using another action to do so. Once you use this ability, you require a short rest before you may use it again.

Oberon, an unrivaled hunter and woodland warrior, is Titania's lover and frequently her foe. Oberon is attuned to every bough of each tree and each branch of every stream in the forests of the Feywild. If Oberon has a weakness, it is the wild nature of his heart. His mood swings like a weathervane in a storm. This powerfully-built horned hunter leads the Wyld Hunt, a collection of powerful fey lords and beasts cursed with a bitter chill that can only be shaken by the blood of the prey.

It journeys between the Realms of Faerie and the Mortal Plane seeking the greatest of challenges and the weakest of souls to harvest. You've encountered the Wyld Hunt and survived where others have fallen, and in return your life has been spared and your bargain made. You've been granted a place at Oberon’s table and the services of his tireless steeds and hunting hounds.

***Frostborn Pack.*** The pack can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the pack can move through any opening large enough for a Medium hound. The pack can’t regain hit points from magical or nonmagical healing or gain temporary hit points. While summoned, the pack recovers all lost hit points whenever you finish a long rest.

***Keen Hunters.*** The hounds have advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell, and can track creatures across water.

***Overwhelming.*** The pack is immune to conditions that only apply to a single hound, such as poison from a weapon attack or a grapple. When determining whether the entire pack is affected by a condition, the hounds count as 4 Medium creatures that take up a 10 ft square. The pack has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that target a single target, such as poison spray.

#### Traits of the Rider
Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after slaying a beast in the Huntsman's name.

| d8 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You enjoy the outdoors immensely. |
| 2 | You harry your foes before killing them. |
| 3 | You boast of your kills at every opportunity. |
| 4 | You take a trophy from everything you hunt. |
| 5 | You frequently mock weaknesses you see. |
| 6 | You count actions over words. |
| 7 | You love the taste of meat. |
| 8 | Antlers sprout from your head. |

### Huntsman's Disciple
Add *Survival* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on it. When you encounter the tracks of a creature, you can summon a spiritual hound to lead you, granting you advantage on checks to track your quarry. It can track targets over water and by scent. The spiritual hound disappears if you roll initiative. In addition, you may choose to leave tracks or not in mundane terrain.

### Pale Rider
You learn to summon a loyal steed from the Huntsman’s stable. You can cast *find steed* without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, its casting time is one action, and you can choose to have the steed appear underneath you, moving you instantly to the saddle.

While you are mounted on the summoned steed, you can choose to take any damage that would be dealt to the steed. When summoned, your steed appears with hit points equal to the amount it had when you dismissed it. While summoned, your steed recovers all lost hit points whenever you finish a long rest.

If your steed has been reduced to 0 hit points, it can’t be summoned again until you finish a long rest.

### Hounds of the Huntsman

<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### The Hounds of the Huntsman
The Hounds of the Huntsman are fearsome and deadly beasts, bred over countless generations to track and harry their prey. They are not made to perform the kill themselves, for that may steal glory from their master. Instead, they are renowned for their unity and purpose, serving with singular intent that cannot be shaken or broken by any force. Those that die in battle vanish in a puff of snow, only to be reborn when the magic of one bound by the Huntsman’s pact calls them forth.
</div>

Gain resistance to cold damage and you are not subject to exhaustion gained from cold environments or high altitudes. You also learn to call the Huntsman’s favored servants.

As an ***action***, you can summon a pack of the Huntsman’s hounds to an empty space within 30 ft. The hounds use the stat block provided with this subclass. The pack understands your commands and obeys you without hesitation, acting on your initiative. Its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your warlock level. When your pack is reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes into frozen mist and can’t be resummoned until you finish a long rest. You can dismiss your pack at any time as an ***action***.

### Cull the Weak
You learn to exploit any sign of weakness from your target. When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by Oberon to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Arrows of the Pursuer
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Arc feature*

    When you target a creature with a ranged weapon attack from your pact weapon using a non-magical arrow, you can coat it with a mystical chill. The target takes 1d6 additional cold damage and that creature's speed is reduced by 10 ft until the start of your next turn. This effect stacks with itself, capable of reducing a creature’s movement to a minimum of 0 ft.

- #### Fleet of Foot
    Your walking speed increases by 10 ft and other creatures have disadvantage on any ability check they make to track or locate you.

- #### Frostbound Armor
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    You gain proficiency in medium armor and heavy armor.

- #### Grim Harvester
    As an action, you can harvest a small trophy from the corpse of a creature that you have slain. You fill the trophy with a fraction of the slain creature’s soul. Until the next dawn, you can use your ***reaction*** to siphon the spiritual energy from the trophy in your possession to gain advantage on an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. Each trophy can only be used once. You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

- #### Lord of Beasts
    *Prerequisite: 13th level*

    Your pack gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to half your Intelligence modifier, and the saving throw associated with its attack equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + half your Intelligence modifier. If you have a familiar, it also gains these bonuses.

- #### Nature's Voice
    *Prerequisite: 14th level*

    You can cast *Commune with nature* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Seeker of Prey
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    When you have a harrowing hawk as your familiar, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level, you can communicate telepathically with your hounds and steed from up to ten miles away, and you can perceive through their senses in the same way you can with your familiar.

- #### Skilled Hunter
    You may spend 2 skill points on one of the following skills: *Animal Handling*, *Nature*, *Perception*, *Physique*, *Stealth* and *Survival*. Whenever you complete a long rest, you may move these skills points.
</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Wild Huntsman warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Harrowing Hawk
    The harrowing hawk is a large bird with stone-cold eyes that is infused with merciless ice. Bred as hunting birds by the Wild Huntsman, these creatures are far deadlier than their cruel visage belies. When they swoop down to attack their prey, they freeze the edges of their wings and slash with the ice-coated feathers, leaving the frost in the wound to slow their victim. As the ice builds, they let out a piercing cry to summon their master to strike down the target from afar. When at rest, they tend to rest upon the shoulders of their masters and gaze menacingly at those around them. They enjoy gifts of carved bone and scrimshaw, which they use to make their nests, and feast upon frozen meat with gusto.

    Harrowing hawks are typically solitary creatures, and rarely cooperate with one another while hunting prey. However, mated pairs are known to hunt together to devastating effect, with one scouting for the other, finding an enticing meal, then letting out a shrill cry. Before the prey can react, the second crashes down with the force of a thunderbolt, slaying the beast instantly. Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.

    When in the service to a warlock aligned to the Huntsman, they serve as scouts and harbingers to the hounds who pursue the prey, seeking to drive them into the clutches of their master. They have a strong bond with the other beasts of the Huntsman’s stable, though are haughty and typically view themselves as the most favored of beasts. The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master’s affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings.

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Master of the Dunes
| 6th | Twisting Sands
| 10th | Shaper of the Sands
| 14th | Desiccate

</div>

In cavernous tombs and unknown temples, or upon gilded thrones backed by arcane might, are those who would choose the moniker of God-King. These mighty beings hold at their beck and call the forgotten magics of the wastes, the untold power of curses, souls, and dark sacrifices, and are willing to share with those who would enforce their will.

Beings such as truly ancient mummy lords, djinn, the Sorcerer-Kings of Athas, or gods such as Set, Anubis, Zann, Al-Ishtus, Apep, Nyarlathotep, Sobek, or Zoser may all make a God-King pact with mortals who seek them out. You, though either luck, determination, or great misfortune, have come under the sway of one of these old masters, and they grant you a portion of their immense power.

#### Pharaoh's Will
The pharaohs of old are not as capricious with their gifts as other patrons may be, and demand much from you. When you make this pact, you gain a bond dependent on the pharaoh to which you are bound. Choose one from the list below, or roll 1d10 to determine randomly:

| | Patron | Bond |
|:----:|:------ |:---- |
| 1 | **Ra** | I glory in the sun, and will endeavor to bring my great and terrible light to all corners of the world. |
| 2 | **Isis** | I seek magic in all its forms, and will stop at nothing to gain a new trinket or bauble. |
| 3 | **Thoth** | Knowledge is power, and I seek to be more powerful than all. No scrap of knowledge shall be kept from my grasp. |
| 4 | **Bast** | Felines are divine beings, and deserve my supplication. I will guide everyone to this great bit of truth. |
| 5 | **Horus** | I am king of kings, lord of lords. I bow to no man, and all will one day bow to me. |
| 6 | **Sekhmet** | This world is impure, forsaken, dying. I seek to revel in its destruction, purified by the terrible light of the sun. |
| 7 | **Hathor** | Joy and mirth are the greatest of all miracles, and I seek to indulge in every form of delight, mortal or otherwise. |
| 8 | **Seth** | The great and vast desert holds the secret to true immortality. I will show all this secret, and cover the world with sand. |
| 9 | **Anubis** | Life is a stain upon the vast majesty of creation. I will remove those weak many who can still die, and create a new paradise for the immortal. |
| 10 | **Amun** | Though I granted them the whole of their world, the mortals have forgotten me. I will show them the true face of their god, and force them to their knees in reverence. |

#### Pharaoh's Curse
Pacts made with a God-King always carry a persistent price that the mortal must pay in exchange for power. This price, known as the Curse, is always levied upon the mortal by the God-King themself, who usually pick a suitable Curse for both the strengths and foibles of the mortal they are empowering. It is recommended you work with your DM to choose a Curse for your character, but you may also determine one randomly by rolling on the God-King’s Curse table included here.

| 1d10 | God-King’s Curse |
|:----:|:---------------- |
| 1 | The skin on your entire body is unnaturally dry and textured like cracked earth
| 2 | The pupils of your eyes are shaped like a goat’s
| 3 | You always appear to be ailing from a specific disease, but suffer no ill effects
| 4 | Scarabs crawl underneath your skin occasionally, causing moving, visible lumps
| 5 | Your body appears gaunt and skeletal, as if you have been withered by age
| 6 | You must bind your arms with treated bandages, or the pores begin to weep viscous black ichor
| 7 | You have a snake’s tongue, and occasionally punctuate words with a hiss
| 8 | You have a persistent, wracking cough, sometimes coughing up live maggots
| 9 | Your fevered mind sees figments and mirages, each relating to your patron’s will
| 10 | The only food you can hold down is fine desert sand

### Master of the Dunes
Your patron imbues you with the hardiness to not only survive in the desert, but thrive. You no longer require food or water, nor do you suffer any ill effects from dehydration. In addition you gain the *Survival - Desert survival* skill and its prerequisite.

### Twisting Sands
When you suffer damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to transform yourself into a whirling cloud of sand. This works as if you had used the *gaseous form* spell. You can return to your normal form at will without using an action, provided there is room to do so.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

If you use this ability while in a desert or over sand, you may do so at will as an ***action***, and gain a movement speed twice your speed.

Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature at will as an action anywhere. Using this feature as a reaction is still limited to once per long rest.

### Shaper of the Sands
The pharaohs grant you the ability to shape the sands to your whims. As an ***action***, you may cast the *fabricate* spell without using a spell slot, though you may only use this ability on sand. You may create objects and structures out of sand, sandstone, or glass.

Additionally, you may use this ability to create weapons and armor you are proficient with out of sand. If anyone other than you attempts to use a weapon or suit of armor created by this feature, the object immediately crumbles into a pile of sand.

### Desiccate
You may attempt to drain vitality from the creatures around you, restoring your own health in the process. As an ***action*** on your turn, you may designate a number of creatures within 60 feet of you equal to your Intelligence modifier. Each of these creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If a creature fails this saving throw, it takes 5d6 necrotic damage, while a creature that succeeds instead takes half this amount. You then regain hit points equal to half the total necrotic damage taken by all the creatures, including those that succeeded the saving throw.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Pharaoh to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Curse of Conscription
    *Prerequisite: 7th level, Pact of the Evil eye*

    If a target affected by your *hex* is reduced to 0 HP, you may choose to end the spell and reanimate the target as a zombie under your control. You can command any zombies under your control as per the *animate dead* spell. When a zombie is reanimated from this feature, you have control over it for 24 hours.

- #### Dance Macabre
    As an ***action***, you may target one undead creature you can see within 30 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours. An undead creature whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect. Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.

- #### Elemental Blade
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    Choose an damage type: fire, acid or lightning. Whenever you summon your pact blade, you may choose for it to deal damage of that type instead of its normal damage type. You make this choice when you take this invocation.

- #### Whispers of the Grave
    *Often, the dead speak to you, whether you'd like them to or not.*

    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    You can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-seducer">The Seducer</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Profane Beauty
| 6th | Persistent Allure
| 10th | Shroud of Secrecy
| 14th | Vampiric Kiss

</div>

Your patron is an entity that rules over lust, temptation, and the night. Fey, fiends, and enchanters each have their own angle for toying with mortal desires. The Seducer selfishly revels in its power and employs mortals to bring others under its spell. The mortals it dominates sacrifice their wealth, secrets, and morals to partake in their newfound vices. Seducer patrons include legendary vampires such as Dracula or Carmilla, Grendel's mother, Lilith, Pan, Shamhat, and unusually powerful succubi or incubi.

### Profane Beauty
Your pact has imbued you with a fiendish beauty that mirrors that of a succubus. Whenever you are not using armor or wielding a shield, you have an armor class equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

Additionally, whenever you roll a saving throw to avoid the charmed condition, you roll at advantage.

Finally, you are the epitome of attractive for your race. Your features are symmetrical, your eyes hypnotizing, and your form is delightful to gaze upon for all those who might care about the form of your sex.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

#### Charming
You may use Charisma instead of Intelligence for all you Warlock features, including your spellcasting ability, invocation and pact features.
</div>

### Persistent Allure
Your charms become even more irresistible. When a creature you target makes a saving throw against your spell or effect that would charm the target, you can use this feature to impose disadvantage on that saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Shroud of Secrecy
Your patron's power infuses you with a shroud of secrecy for you to conduct your affairs. Whenever you are the target of a divination spell or about to be percieved through magical scrying sensors, you are immediately aware of it and can use a ***reaction*** to shroud yourself with a *nondetection* spell.

Additionally, you can now cast *alter self* as an ***action***, but it does not require concentration.

### Vampiric Kiss
You can drain a victim's life force with a kiss. As an ***action***, you may kiss a charmed or otherwise willing creature, or make a melee spell attack. Your target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save or be charmed and incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn, while also suffering 5d10 necrotic damage that it interprets as a euphoric, sensual feeling. You heal an equal amount of damage.

As an ***action*** on subsequent turns, you may maintain this effect, requiring a new saving throw by the target to charm and incapacitate them and deal 2d10 necrotic damage, which you also heal. You may continue to maintain this ability until the target saves, it dies, or you decide to no longer maintain it.

After you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before you may use it again.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Seducer to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Mask of Many Faces
    *You begin to slowly assemble a more perfect image of yourself as you use this ability. You tweak your nose, your eyes, your teeth until you have achieved a perfect mask that represents yourself. Over time you begin to resent your actual physical appearance, hiding it whenever possible.*

    You can cast *disguise* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-shadowCat">The Shadowcat</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Dream Stalker
| 6th | Stolen Luck
| 10th | Umbral Leap
| 14th |Dark Apparition

</div>

Your patron is an otherworldly incarnation of fate that strides between planes; a living omen of ill luck and good fortune alike. Drawn to the dreams of mortals, its lesser reflections perch upon the chests of the unwary in their sleep, stealing breath and fragments of life from their victims as they feed upon the nightmares this brings. When they’ve had their fill, they return to their master, who sends them back again to hunt down the creatures that have escaped from the nightmares of those tormented by darker fates. You’ve drawn the attention of this creature, for good or ill, and have made your pact in the deepest shadows of the dark.

#### Traits of the Shadestrider
Servants of the Shadowcat are often known as shadestriders. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock.

| d14 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You feel most comfortable in the dark. |
| 2 | You prefer to be nocturnal in your habits. |
| 3 | You enjoy watching others sleep. |
| 4 | You tend to grin widely and inappropriately.
| 5 | You curl your back and bare your teeth when you are threatened. |
| 6 | Your skin has wisps of shadow coming from it. |
| 7 | Your irises and eyes are shaped like those of a cat. |
| 8 | You sometimes hiss when startled.
| 9 | Your shadow seems to pace beside you, even against the light. The effect is disconcerting to others. |
| 10 | When you cast a spell, your eyes glow with a blue light, and shadows pour from your hands. |
| 11 | Your blood is thick and dark like ink.
| 12 | Your skin fades to an obsidian shade in shadow.
| 13 | Your teeth become fanged and sharp.
| 14 | You move in a way that is oddly catlike.

### Dream Stalker
Your patron’s magic allows you to be everywhere and nowhere at once. As an ***action***, you can fade partway into the shadows, gaining advantage on Stealth checks for 1 hour.

When you roll initiative while in this state and in shadow, you can choose to teleport up to 60 ft to a location within 10 feet of a creature you can see. If you deal damage to the creature with an attack during the first round of combat, you can use your ***bonus action*** to steal their breath and spirit. The target takes psychic damage equal to your warlock level and cannot speak or make sound until the start of your next turn.

### Stolen Luck
You can curse an enemy within 60 ft with terrible misfortune as a ***bonus action***. Whenever the target makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your ***reaction*** to roll a d6 after seeing the result. If the result is a 6, the result of their d20 roll is replaced with a 1. This curse lasts for one minute, and ends early if either you or the target are reduced to 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Umbral Leap
Whenever you are subject to an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** to instantly dissolve into a dark mist to avoid the initial effect. You reappear in an unoccupied space of your choosing within 30 ft of your initial location.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Dark Apparition
The Shadowcat’s hunger for nightmares grants you the power to create them. You can no longer be surprised. Whenever you use your Dream Stalker feature’s ***bonus action***, all hostile creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Shadowcat to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Armor of the Shadowcat
    *The shadows around you often move and seem lazily drawn to you, forming unnatural shapes and appendages that are, nevertheless, only shadows.*

    You can envelop yourself with shadows, giving you a base AC of 13 + Dexterity modifier by using an ***action***. While active, this also allows you to add your Intelligence modifier to Stealth and Intimidation checks, but you have an equal penalty to Charisma checks.

    The shadows remain until you dismiss or until your next long rest.

- #### Duskborne Companion
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    If you have a dimcat as your familiar, it gains additional maximum hit points equal to your warlock level. Whenever you cast a spell using a warlock spell slot, while you can see your dimcat, you can choose to teleport up to 30 ft to a location adjacent to the familiar.

- #### Everburning Gaze
    *You silently obsess over the forces of luck, and strongly consider certain courses of action based on how lucky you are feeling over logic or reason.*

    *Prerequisite: 12th level*

    When using the Stolen Luck feature, the target’s d20 roll is changed to a 1 if the result of your d6 roll is a 5 or 6. In addition, target creature gains disadvantage on their next attack roll.

- #### Fang of the Prowler
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

    When you create a melee weapon with the finesse property using your Pact of the Blade feature, you can make it from polished silver flowing with blue-black smoke. While wielding this weapon, you gain advantage on initiative rolls. During the first round of combat, attacks with this weapon deal extra psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier plus half your warlock level.

- #### Nightmares
    *The fears that chase creatures' in their slumber are yours to read.*

    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    You can force a creature within 30 ft of you to make a Wisdom saving against your warlock spell save DC or have one of its fears inscribed in your tome. You may have a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier affected in this way. You gain advantage on Intimidation and Insight checks against a creature whose fears you have written in your tome.

- #### One with Shadows
    *Bright light makes you uncomfortable, and you avoid it when possible.*

    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your ***action*** to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.

- #### Sleepless Nights
    You no longer need to sleep and can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you must still perform only light activity, such as reading or keeping watch.

</div>

### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Shadowcat warlocks who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Dimcat
    The dimcat is a small feline creature that cloaks itself in shadow, and feeds on the nightmares of the unwary. Creatures that draw their ire find themselves wreathed in blinding blackness before being bitten by the cat, filling their minds with a psychic onslaught of nightmares. The dimcat feeds on the doubts, fears, and nightmares of sleeping mortal adults, sitting upon them with mouth outstretched to catch the fever dreams as they rise in a black mist. While the Shadowcat and its reflections feed on nightmares, those of children are bitter and unworthy of their elegant and refined taste.

    Those who awaken only see the stark blue eyes shining down at them, and are paralyzed by the strange power of the dimcat. When at rest, they are silent and watchful, seeming to enjoy batting out burning candles and other sources of light.

    Dimcats speak in a wide variety of voices and have many strange and enigmatic personalities, but most can be described as one might expect: haughty, overbearing, demanding, sly, clever, charming, affectionate, enigmatic, mysterious, deceptive, curious, and practically any other term one might use to describe an actual cat.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-stormLord">The Storm Lord</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Majesty of the Cloud Ruler
| 6th | Breath of the Gale
| 10th | Rider of Lightning
| 14th |Slayer of the King

</div>

You’ve made a pact with an ancient power known as the Storm Lord. Massive and timeless, this godlike entity sails the winds of the void through the darkest places between the skies of countless worlds. It is the spirit that consumes the purified souls of heroes as it welcomes them into its kingdom. Its long tendrils of lightning cover the sky, heralding the violent tempest that follows.

This entity finds silent amusement at seeing mortals in peril, and it tends to draw cults of shadowy beings to worship at its altars, performing dark rituals in the name of the Lord of Winds. You have stood before the Storm Lord, unbowed and unbroken, to make a pact that will shake the very fabric of reality. Sparks will leap from your fingertips and fog will rise from your breath as you strike down your enemies with the devastating and majestic power of the Master of the Unfallen Kingdom.

#### Harbinger of the End
The Storm Lord frequently appears as a massive serpentine eel-like creature with white clouds concealing the majority of its form. Its eyes glow with golden light like the sun bursting through clouds. The presence of the Lord causes even kings and rules to drop to their knees in supplication and awe of the sheer overwhelming majesty of this eternal being.

The swirling tempest that follows the Storm Lord is filled with the remnants of the souls of heroes and champions who have fought and died in both glorious combat and in the natural disasters that follow in its wake.

#### The Living Whirlwind
Those driven by anger and anguish are most drawn to the Storm Lord, taken in by thoughts of rebellion against the current order of things. Outcasts and priests of fallen religions, deserters and traitors, and even those simply dissatisfied with their station in life often visit the high places of the world to stand before the dangerous winds and crashing lighting, crying out to the sky for answers.

Those who truly accept their insignificance hear the voice of the Storm Lord booming in the thunder and the chanting of the fallen heroic souls in the pounding of the rain.

#### Traits of the Herald
Those who serve the Storm Lord through pacts and promises are known as heralds, as they stand before other mortals and speak of the coming chaos and salvation that will arrive as their master does. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after sending the soul of a hero to the Storm Lord.

| d10 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------------|
| 1 | You feel uncomfortable in heavy clothing and would rather stand unprotected from the elements.
| 2 | You enjoy even the most extreme weather, laughing as thunder booms and lightning cracks.
| 3 | You frequently wear dark robes or clothing that conceals your form.
| 4 | You do not ask, you declare.
| 5 | Your skin has wisps of fog coming from it that flash brightly when lightning crackles nearby.
| 6 | Your eyes change color to match the sky above you.
| 7 | Your skin crackles with sparks when rubbed.
| 8 | Your face is cruel and alien to behold.
| 9 | When you cast a spell, your eyes glow with a blue light and mist pours from your hands.
| 10 | You tend to grin widely when watching the suffering of others.


### Majesty of the Cloud Ruler
Gain the ability to manifest a fraction of the awe-inspiring glory of the Storm Lord. As an ***action***, choose any number of creatures in a 15 ft radius of you. The targets must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they fall prone and remain prone on their next turn unless they use all of their movement to stand.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Breath of the Gale
You passively manifest a small tempest around yourself. You gain advantage on saving throws against dangerous gases, clouds, forceful winds, and other similar effects. Your vision is not obscured by fog, mist, smoke, rain, clouds, or other airborne particles.

Additionally, whenever you take the Dash action, nonmagical ranged attacks that target you are made with disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

### Rider of Lightning
When you deal lightning or thunder damage using a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your ***bonus action*** to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to a target of the spell or to an unoccupied space within the spell’s area of effect.

### Slayer of the King
You discover the unspoken secrets of the heroes who sought the downfall of the Storm Lord. As an ***action***, you cleave the air with a blade of purest wind in a line 300 ft long, 300 ft high and 5 ft wide.

Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. A creature takes force damage equal to three times your warlock level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Unattended objects automatically fail this saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Storm Lord to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Arc Lightning
    *Prerequisite: 11th level*

    When you make a cantrip or weapon attack, you can use a ***bonus action*** to cast *lightning bolt* using a warlock spell slot at a target of your  attack.

- #### Dance of the Storm
    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    You can cast *fly* on yourself at will without expending a spell slot or material components.

- #### Essence of the Sky
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    If you have a spark seeker as your familiar, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level. While you have a spark seeker as your familiar, you can cast spells that deal lightning or thunder damage as though your familiar was the point of origin for the spell when determining the range and available targets.

- #### Grasp of the Storm Lord
    When you cast *shocking grasp*, you can expend a warlock spell slot to amplify the attack. You gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to the level of the spell slot. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage per level of the spell slot and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be paralyzed until the start of your next turn.

- #### Grimoire of the Endless Rain
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

    Whenever you finish a long rest, you can perform a percussive ritual over the course of 10 minutes to change the weather. When you finish, an unnatural storm with a 1-mile radius rolls in and follows you, gently raining and occasionally flashing with lightning.

    When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while outside, you can use your ***reaction*** to call down a bolt of lightning to strike the downed creature. Each creature that you choose within a 10-foot radius of the strike must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they take thunder damage equal to your warlock level and are deafened for 1 minute.

    Once you summon lightning this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Lightning Retaliation
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Bastion*

    When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to emit a blast of lightning from your pact shield, dealing lightning damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, and granting temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

</div>


### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to servants of the Storm Lord, who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Spark Seeker
    The spark seeker is a small, manta-ray-like creature that floats on the winds and uses them for defense. Once parasites that crawled upon the hide of the Storm Lord, the spark seekers have been touched by the legendary power of the godlike being and have grown and changed, gaining the ability to wield magical energies in exchange for service to the Lord. When threatened, they craft a shard of crystal by compressing the dust in the air around them and firing it at their target after charging it with electricity.

    When at rest, they scuttle along at a slow pace, finding a nook in some stone to lie in on a side that is exposed to the wind and elements. They enjoy gifts of meat and perfumes, and chirp excitedly when they are carried around. At night, colonies of spark seekers perform elaborate mating dances, lighting up the sky with flashes of lightning and strong gusts of wind. An entire colony of them working in concert can start a summon a massive and terrible storm, making them dangerous when near civilized areas.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-undying">The Undying</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Immortal's Curse
| 6th | Defy Death
| 10th | Among the Eternal
| 14th |Master of Their Own Fate

</div>

Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize – like all power – comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Larloch the Shadow King.

### Immortal's Curse
Gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a ***bonus action***, choose one creature you can see within 30 ft. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

* Your damage rolls deal an additional amount of necrotic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
* When you score a critical hit with an attack, you can roll one additional damage die and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
* If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Defy Death
You can cheat death and regain some vitality. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier when you succeed on a death saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Among the Eternal
You no longer require food, water, air or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

Additionally, you gain resistance to necrotic damage, immunity to disease, and your hit point maximum increases by 10 and increases again by 1 whenever you gain a level in this class.

### Master of Their Own Fate
You partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Undying to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Accursed Specter
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid that is cursed by the *hex* spell or by your Immortal's Curse, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. It obeys your verbal commands, and it can take the Help action as a bonus action.

    The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Corpus Commander
    *Prerequisite: 12th level*

    Your presence acts as a source of inspiration for your undead cohorts. Undead you control within 30 ft add your Intelligence modifier to their attack rolls and saving throws.

- #### Fell Drain
    If you reduce a hostile humanoid to 0 hit points with a spell using necrotic damage, you can choose to animate it as a zombie. The zombie dies after one minute. Once you do this, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Powerful Horde
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    Your patron has instilled within you a greater understanding of negative energy. When you create or gain control of an undead creature, that creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level.

    Additionally, undead you control deal additional necrotic damage with their attacks equal to your Intelligence modifier.

- #### Rigor Mortis
    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    You have become a master of necromancy, creating undead meant to last. When you create or gain control of an undead creature, bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage it takes is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, undead you control have an AC equal to your Warlock spell save DC.

- #### Ritual Thralls
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    You can cast *animate dead* once without using a spell slot. When you do so, you can reanimate one additional corpse. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation again.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-vampire">Vampire</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Vampiric Presence
| 6th | Shapes of Twilight
| 10th | Life Drain
| 14th |Unholy Might

</div>

Vampires are known as the absolute masters of the night. They are powerful, violent, and terrifying beyond measure. Despite that, one of the defining traits of the master vampire is his unfailing ability to draw others to him, to bind them to his service, and to subjugate them with his awe.

Warlocks who take this pact seek to gain a measure of a master vampire's incredible strength, intimidating presence, and immortal stamina. They desire to become true masters of the night, and, eventually, vampires in their own right.

#### Warlock Quirks
Making a pact with a vampire sometimes takes it's toll on a creature, and has it's side effects. As an optional way to add more flavor to your character, you can pick from or roll on the following table of quirks.

| d6 | Quirk |
|:--:|:----- |
| 1 | Your skin is incredibly pale, as if you have never seen the sun. |
| 2 | You have an obsession with blood, and behave in unpredictable ways in it's prescence. |
| 3 | You are unnaturally attractive. |
| 4 | You feel slightly nauseous when in direct sunlight. |
| 5	| You are uncomfortable with entering a dwelling when you have not been invited to enter. |
| 6 | You cast no shadow unless in direct sunlight. |

### Vampiric Presence
Your patron shares with you some of their charm and guile. Add *Speechcraft* to your class skills and gain 1 skill point to spend on it.

Also, you gain the ability to bewitch humanoids. You can cast the *charm* spell on anyone meeting your gaze, without using any verbal or somatic components.

Once you charm a creature with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Shapes of Twilight
Your patron grants you their shapechanging abilities. You can cast the *polymorph* spell on yourself to change into a bat, rat, or wolf. Once cast in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Also, you can cast the *gaseous form* spell as a ***reaction*** to taking damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points. When cast in this way, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. When cast in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Life Drain
Gain the power to drain the vitality of a creature with a touch, and make it your own. As an ***action***, you can touch a crature, forcing it to make a Constitiution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 8d8 necrotic damage and is stunned for until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

This damage reduces a target's hit point maximum by an equal amount until they finish a long rest. A creature charmed by you takes maximum damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Unholy Might
The vampire grants you their physical prowess and supernatural vigor. Gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength ability checks.
- You can add your proficiency bonus to Initiative checks.
- Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your warlock level, and increases by 1 again each time you gain a level in this class.
- You regain 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns while you are below half of your hit point maximum, provided you have at least 1 hit point, and not in direct sunlight or running water

### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Vampire to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Dance Macabre
    As an ***action***, you may target one undead creature you can see within 30 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours. An undead creature whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect. Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-weaverLies">The Weaver of Lies</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Patron Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Poisoned Mind
| 6th | A Touch on the Web
| 10th | Trickster’s Dance
| 14th |Sinful Puppeteer

</div>

In the beginning, the world was created. Many argue about how this was done, but most accept that it was the actions of the gods themselves that led to the creation of life upon the Material Plane. However, there is one being that was not created deliberately by any deity and was not spawned upon some far and god-forsaken plane. Instead, it is a creature born when the forces responsible for the creation of the world acted with deceit for the first time. Those who delve deep into the ancient texts call this creature the Weaver of Lies.

#### The Great Deceiver
The Weaver of Lies is often depicted as a massive spiderlike creature with an eerily human mouth and a long, nightmarish tongue. Webs of spider-silk and woven shadow adorn its purplish chitinous body, and religious symbols hang blasphemously from those tattered threads. Its golden-green eyes glare unblinking at those that stand before it, dull and remorseless in the subtle light of its lair. Barbed spines grow from its back and head, forming a twisted crown that seems a mockery of any true regalia. Those who have heard it speak are said to describe its voice as wholesome and trustworthy, despite the obviously deceptive source.

#### A Vengeful Creation
Those who have studied the lore surrounding the Weaver of Lies seem to agree upon one fact about this dark entity: it is the enemy of the gods themselves. It intends to destroy them, exacting a punishment upon these powerful deities for the crime of its own birth. It is a being filled with sly and subtle hatred for all of the higher powers that created the world, thinking them villains in a plot of its own devising.

It holds the gods of evil and deceit in contempt, viewing them as fools for continuing to speak and fuel its power, while considering gods of good and justice as hypocrites, knowing that by their own creation of the mortal races, they have contributed directly to the making of those creatures that are capable of the infinite creation of lies and deceptions. The Weaver is empowered by these deceits, according to the scholars and preachers of divine law, but even they do not know if their statements are true.

#### Reality and Incomprehension
The Weaver is more than just a liar: it is a lie. Everything about it is fake and false, even when it is true. This is often difficult for mortal minds to begin to grasp, but at a fundamental level, it remains. The Weaver does not obey the laws of the universe, because to it, those laws are lies. It defies them, it breaks them, and it rewrites them in accordance with its plans and wishes. It is the equal to the deities that it hates, and is only kept in check by the eldritch forces and older, darker powers that exist on the edges of reality.

#### Call to Regret
The Weaver of Lies is not commonly sought willingly. The rare few who do desire to make pacts with this eldritch entity are those that wish to no longer know the truth. Betrayers and murderers, torturers and liars who have seen the harm they have caused and rejected the outcomes will go and kneel before the Weaver, begging to have their memories taken and their minds filled with doubt so they may deny the consequences of their actions. Victims of horrible fates will stand before the Weaver and smile as their past afflictions become little more than another bad dream, something that need not trouble them any longer. Warlocks of the Weaver lie to themselves as much as they lie to others. There is a pride in their blackened hearts, to see the truth, reject it, and weave a new one. The Weaver’s webs are everywhere, and it will create a reality that is universal: one where everything is a lie.

#### Traits of the Spidersworn
The blissful heresy of a servant of the Weaver comes from a corruption of the mind and soul. Consider adding one or more of these traits when creating a warlock or after spinning a great web of lies in service to the Weaver.

| d12 | Trait |
|:---:|:------|
| 1 | You take advantage of the gullible at every opportunity.
| 2 | You view the gods in a poor light.
| 3 | You greatly enjoy fooling the wicked.
| 4 | You view trusting people as tools for your use.
| 5 | You frequently reject the logical arguments of others.
| 6 | You do not tell, you imply.
| 7 | You enjoy betrayal, even against yourself.
| 8 | Your eyes become a reflective black or green.
| 9 | Your blood is yellow, like the ichor of an arachnid.
| 10 | Your shadow is always cast directly towards the nearest light source.
| 11 | You enjoy telling tall tales.
| 12 |  When you cast a spell with a verbal component, shadows shaped like spiders crawl from your mouth and rush to cover your hands.

### Poisoned Mind
When you forge this pact at 1st level, your patron teaches you the first lie ever told. Gain *Speechcraft - Deception* and its prerequisite.

In addition, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher than affects one or more hostile creatures, you can use your ***bonus action*** to force one of the targets of the spell to make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If the creature fails, it is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

### A Touch on the Web
You learn to summon the slaves of the Weaver to extract vengeance. Whenever you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to summon a horde of spiders to cover your attacker, biting and tearing into them.

The target takes magical piercing damage equal to your warlock level and must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they are poisoned for one minute. While they are poisoned, they are also frightened of you. They can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effects on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

### Trickster’s Dance
You can deceive even the fabric of reality. You can’t suffer disadvantage on saving throws. Additionally, you can cast *mislead* without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Sinful Puppeteer
Your blood flows with poison and your hands dance upon a loom of false spidersilk. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. As an ***action***, you can attempt to magically ensnare and control the actions of a creature that you can see within 60 ft. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, the creature is caught in your web of lies.

On your turn, you can use your ***bonus action*** to take total and precise control of the ensnared creature. While the target is under your control, you can see through your target’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the target has. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only actions that you choose and can’t do anything that you don’t allow it to. During this time, you can use your ***reaction*** to force the creature to use it’s reaction.

The creature remains completely unaware that you have acted upon it and feels certain that any actions it performed were of its own free will. Once you control the creature once, your hold over it is broken.

Once you attempt to magically ensnare a creature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.



### Patron Invocations
The following invocations are granted by the Weaver of Lies to its warlocks.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Assassin in the Dark
    *Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

    If you have a shade widow as your familiar, it gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level. Whenever it uses the Bite action, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the target’s first Constitution saving throw against the widow’s poison.

- #### Binding Blast
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    Whenever you cast a spell that targets more than one creature and inflicts damage, you can use your ***bonus action*** to send transparent webbing to bind all targets that took damage from the spell. A bound target cannot move from they were when you cast the spell unless they succeed a Strength check against your warlock spell save DC. Forced movement, such as a shove, automatically breaks the webbing. The webbing dissolves into dust at the start of your next turn.

- #### Blasphemous Whisper
    *Prerequisite: 12th level*

    You can now activate the Poisoned Mind feature whenever you cast a cantrip that targets one or more hostile creatures.

- #### Lair of the Liar
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast the *web* spell once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short rest.

    Whenever you cast *web* and maintain concentration for the full duration, you can choose to have the web become permanent and impossible to dispel.

</div>







### Pact of the Chain Familiar
The following familiar is available to Spidersworn who have selected the Pact of the Chain feature.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Shade Widow
    The shade widow is an eerily silent spider-shaped construct made entirely of animate webbing and shaped obsidian. Created by the Weaver of Lies as assassins, these deadly objects are used to tie up loose ends wherever they arise. They’ll often lie in wait under the beds of unsuspecting victims before emerging to bite with fangs coated in magical poison. Acolytes of the Weaver are fond of them due to their ability to create massive webs, making them invaluable while fleeing from an angry mob after the lies they’ve spun fall to tatters.

    ***Magic Resistance.*** The shade widow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

    ***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the shade widow knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

    ***Web Weaver.*** The shade widow can produce enough natural webbing per minute to cover a 10-foot radius. This webbing adheres to creatures and objects. If a creature falls prone in a space covered in webbing, or is shoved into a wall covered in webbing, its movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-invocations">Eldritch Invocations</a></h2>

In your study of occult lore, you unearth eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Warlock table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

The invocations are listed alphabetically in the following categories:
- ***General invocations***
- ***Invocations that grant spells***
- ***Invocations that improve cantrips***
- ***Invocations that improve spells***

Additionally you have access to unique invocations from your Otherworldly Patron, as well as from you Pact boon. Add these to your list of Eldritch Invocation options

### General invocations

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Barred Mind
    Whenever you make a Wisdom saving throw and succeed, your mind locks shut. If the same creature or effect forces you to make another Wisdom saving throw within one minute, that saving throw is made with advantage, and you may cast a cantrip as a ***reaction***.

- #### Beguiling Influence
    *People seem somehow to be magnetically drawn to you. It is hard for you to find time alone without interruption.*

    Gain 2 skill point to spend on *Speechcraft*.
    
- #### Deflect Elements
    *Prerequisites: 5th level*

    When you are hit by a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage, you can use your ***reaction*** to decrease that damage by 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can redirect the spell towards a creature within range using your spellcasting modifier or spell save DC as appropriate.

    You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all uses after a long rest.

- #### Devil's Sight
    *There is something unorthodox about your eyes - perhaps they have an unnatural color, or are all black, or have a slitted iris like a cat or snake.*

    You can see normally in nonmagical darkness, to a distance of 30 ft.

- #### Evil Eye
    As an ***action***, you imbue your eyes with eldritch magic and glare darkly at a creature. If the target can see you, it suffers disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check made within 1 minute.

- #### Eyes of the Rune Keeper
    *Any language you do not know how to speak you wholly fixate on, tracing the written syllables and enunciating the writing slowly as you read it, often regardless of what is happening around you.*

    You can read all writing.

- #### Gaze of Two Minds
    You can use your ***action*** to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your ***action*** on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn.

    While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

- #### Hidden Pocket
    As an ***action***, you can touch one unattended nonmagical object that weighs less than 30 pounds, such as a shield, gemstone, or glaive. The object disappears into a hidden pocket dimension. As an ***action*** on a subsequent turn, you can access this pocket dimension to retrieve the item.

    You can have only one item stored at a time, and an item that is under the effects of a magical spell or effect cannot be stored. If you die or are reduced to 0 hit points, the item exits the pocket dimension and falls to the ground in your space.

- #### Master of Malediction
    As a ***bonus action***, you place a curse upon a creature within 60 ft. As long as you concentrat or up to one hour, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack.

    Also, choose one ability when you use this effect. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability. This effect does not stack with hex.

    You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all uses after a long rest.

- #### Nightmare Mask
    A creature that is frightened of you, or a creature that you successfully intimidated, does not remember your appearance or identity after the encounter, unless you choose for them to remember you.

- #### Noxious Form
    *Prerequisites: 7th level*

    You can spend a warlock spell slot to cast *gaseous form* without requiring components. When cast in this way, while you are occupying another creature’s space, it takes poison damage equal to your Intelligence modifier at the start of each of their turns for as long as it or you remain there.

- #### Secretive Speech
    You can choose to speak in an otherworldly tongue. When you do, the only people who can understand you are those you choose, even if they speak a different language. To others, this speech sounds like the ramblings of a lunatic, a chittering beast, or undiscernable whispers, depending on the volume.

</div>

### Invocations that grant spells

The following invocations grant extra spells, that can usually be used at will, without expending spell slots or material components.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Armor of Shadows
    *The shadows around you often move and seem lazily drawn to you, forming unnatural shapes and appendages that are, nevertheless, only shadows.*

    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast *compulsion* once without expending a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

- #### Eldritch Sight
    *Sometimes you see magical figments that float just at the edges of your field of view. You almost always know these for what they are, and dismiss them as such.*

    You can cast *detect magic* without expending a spell slot.

- #### Fiendish Vigor
    *After using this ability your skin visibly and physically toughens, being more weathered hide than mortal skin. Your skin returns to normal after a short rest.*

- #### Ghoulish Steed
    *Prerequisite: 7th level*

    You can cast the spell *find greater steed* without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-boon">Pact Boons</a></h2>

In the long, storied history of outsiders meddling with and granting power to mortals, no two pacts struck have ever been exactly the same. Mortals are creatures of many needs, some being far more important than others. Most patrons by their nature are providing sorts, and tend to give the mortals at least a semblance of what they desire if only to more fully ensure that the mortals are willing and alive long enough to fulfill their patron's dread will.

When you make a pact with your patron, you are rewarded with a boon—a special artifact that symbolizes the eldritch bargain that has been struck.

#### Choosing Your Pact
Choose your pact from one of the following options:

|  |  |
|:-|:-|
| **Pact of the Arc** | You want vengeance, and are rewarded with a bow to strike down your enemies.
| **Pact of the Bastion** | You aspire to be invulnerable, and are gifted an inpenetrable  shield.
| **Pact of the Blade** | You want physical power, and you are rewarded with an eldritch weapon.
| **Pact of the Chain** | You want to control others, and are gifted a familiar-summoning trinket.
| **Pact of the Cowl** | You want to escape notice of those who threaten you, and are rewarded with a cloak or cape.
| **Pact of the Evil Eye** | You want to make your enemies suffer, and are gifted with the ability to curse others.
| **Pact of the Talisman** | You want to destroy your enemies, and you are rewarded with a talisman of power.
| **Pact of the Tome** | You want forbidden knowledge, and you are rewarded with an eldritch spellbook.

Your pact boon artifact bears the unmistakable mark of your patron—fiendish red veins, fey vines and flowers, aberrant runes and etchings, etc. You may decide how your artifact is branded by your patron.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheArc">Pact of the Arc</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Pact Weapon
| 3rd | Assimilate
| 5th | Extra Attack
| 7th | Eldritch Arrows
| 9th | Banish

</div>

The ability to strike quickly from a distance is a valuable skill, and your patron has bestowed a bow upon you to allow you to lay low your enemies while escaping from harm. This may be such things as a long, slender twig plucked from the most ancient tree in the Feywild strung with unicorn mane thread, or a burning construct of hot iron bound with strands of liquid flame, or a fibrous, living thing molded from bone and sinew of creatures best left unknown.

### Pact weapon
You gain a unique, eldritch weapon from your patron, which takes the form or a bow or crossbow. This weapon is honed and shaped by your own mind—the stronger your intellect, the stronger it strikes.

You can spend one ***action*** to summon your pact weapon into your empty hand.

 **Eldritch Strike**. When you attack with this weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier (instead of Strength) for the attack and damage rolls.

 **Magical Origin**. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

 **Ephemeral**. This weapon disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

### Assimilate
You can absorb the arcane properties of a magic ranged weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special, eldritch ritual.

The ritual takes 1 hour, during which all magic properties will be transferred into your pact weapon. The original weapon looses all magic and becomes a mundane weapon. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. Whenever you perform this ritual, only the properties of the last weapon remain.

### Extra Attack
You can attack with your pact weapon twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Eldritch Arrows
As a ***bonus action*** you can channel the magics of your cantrips into your pact weapon, empowering the next arrow fired. You may cast any of your single target cantrips through your pact weapon this way. If the arrow hits, the target is considered to be hit by the cantrip as well, dealing damage by both. If the cantrip aloows a save, it is considered failed.

While channeled through your pact weapon, the cantrip uses either the maximum range of the spell or your weapon, whichever is further, and neither confers disadvantage for long range.

### Banish
When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can choose to banish it. If it fails a Charisma save against your spell save DC, it is banished to a demiplane controlled by your patron. It remains there as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute.

While banished, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it succeeds, or the duration expires, the creature reappears in the space it left (or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied). If it fails, the creature instead suffers 1d10 force damage.

If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points while banished, it does not return and you regain one expended spell slot.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Arc.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Outsider's agility
    When an enemy ends their movement adjacent to you, you may use your ***reaction*** to disengage and move 5 ft away from them.

    Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Uncanny aim
    *You are unusually certain that danger exists just behind the next wall, around the next bend.*

    When making an attack with your pact weapon (including channeling your cantrips through it), you ignore any kind of cover besides total cover.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheBastion">Pact of the Bastion</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Pact Weapon
| 3rd | Assimilate
| 5th | Extra Attack
| 7th | Eldritch Rebuke
| 9th | Ethereal Shell

</div>

While any pact that a warlock makes is by definition a pact for power, some few warlocks wish to use this power for the purposes of protection - either for themselves, or for others. When this is the case, a warlock's patron may provide them with a bastion, or a pact shield, with which to defend themselves.

This shield may be of any make or composition; it could be simple and elegant, wrought from iron-hard white wood, or it could be an impenetrable barrier of dark fiendish iron, or an otherworldly blockade grown of chitin and nodulus vestigial eyes.

### Pact Shield
You gain a unique, eldritch shield from your patron. This shield is shaped and hardened by your own mind—the stronger your intellect, the more it can resist.

You can spend one ***action*** to summon your pact shield into your empty hand.

 **Eldritch Protection**. When using this shield and no other armor, you can choose to have a base AC or 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

 **Magical Origin**. It cannot be affected by any magic changing it, including *polymorph object* or *heat metal*, unless you allow it.

 **Ephemeral**. The shield disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the shield (no action required), or if you die.

In addition, you gain the *Medium armor* combat skill and 2 additional skill points to spend on weapon groups.

### Assimilate
You can absorb the arcane properties of a magic shield into your pact shield by performing a special, eldritch ritual.

The ritual takes 1 hour, during which all magic properties will be transferred into your pact shield. The original shield looses all magic and becomes mundane. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient item in this way. Whenever you perform this ritual, only the properties of the last shield remain.

### Extra Attack
While wearing the shield, you can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action.

### Eldritch Rebuke
When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you may use your ***reaction*** to expend a warlock spell slot to blast the attacker in retribution. You deal 1d8 force damage + an additional 1d8 force damage per spell slot level. The target is then pushed 5 ft away for every level of the spell slot expended.

### Ethereal Shell
As an action, you may form a hemispherical dome with a radius of up to 10 ft. This dome is utterly impenetrable, confers total cover and blocks line of sight - you cannot hear or see anything outside the dome while inside it, and vice versa. This dome lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can't use this ability again until you finish a short rest.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Bastion.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Chimeric aegis
    *Holding your pact shield fills you with a surprising and occasionally potent feeling of invulnerability.*

    When holding your pact shield, you can cast *protection from energy* and *shield* spell on yourself without expending a spell slot. You can cast each spell once, and regain their use when you finish a short rest.

If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.

### Eldritch Brand
When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you may choose to brand the creature and deal an extra 1d6 force damage per your spell slot level.

The creature also cannot benefit from the Invisible condition until the mark expires.

</div>

You ask your patron for the ability to control others, and are rewarded with a bound familiar. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its form can be a reflection of your patron, with Sprites, Pseudodragons and Tressym (winged cat from *Storm King's Thunder*) tied to the patrons of the natural world, and Imps and Quasits tied to fiends.

A warlock of Death or Undeath may have a Crawling Claw or a Raven as a familiar, or a skeletal or spectral versions of other familiars.

Tressym also commonly follow warlocks of the Pharaoh and the Seducer.

Warlocks of the Cosmic Machine sometimes have Clockwork beetles or Library automatons (*Tome of Beasts*) as familiars.

Warlocks following the Great Old One have access to more otherworldly familiars, such as <a href="../Resources/familiars-alternative-great-old-one.html">the Gibbering Orblet and Flumphling</a>, or the Gazer (*Volo's Guide to Monsters)*.

An eldritch trinket, such as a ring, bracelet, earring, or a diadem. Your trinket bears the unmistakable mark of your patron—fiendish red veins, fey vines and flowers, aberrant runes and etchings, etc.

While you are wearing this trinket, you can summon the familiar with a 10 minute ritual. You can dismiss it without spending an action. If your familiar is killed, it vanishes, and you can not summon it until after a long rest. The familiar regains all its hit points after a long rest, including if it was reduced to 0 hp.

 **Chainmaster**. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to spend its reaction and make one attack of its own.

 **I serve**. Your familiar has a personality of its own—it may or may not be happy to serve you. But whatever its attitude, the familiar must obey the command of whomever wears the trinket.

### Mutation

<div class="columns">

    Your familiar gains a swimming speed of 40 ft.

Whenever you summon your familiar, you can choose two mutations to apply to it.

### Chain Tyrant
You can spend your ***bonus action*** to command your familiar to make one attack.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Chain.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Chains of Carceri
    *You have a fascination with ropes, chains, and anything used to bind. You often find yourself unconsciously manipulating these objects if they are in the room with you.*

    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    You can cast *hold monster* at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

- #### Cognizance Duality
    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    You can have your familiar concentrate on a spell you have cast on your behalf. While your familiar is concentrating on a spell, it can't take actions or reactions. Your familiar must be within 60 ft to gain this benefit.

- #### Sacrificial Demise
    *Prerequisites: 6th level*

    As an ***action***, you can cause your familiar to sacrifice itself in an explosion of eldritch power. Choose any damage type that the familiar can inflict with an attack. Creatures within 20 ft of your familiar must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they take 1d6 damage of the chosen type per two warlock levels you possess or half as much if they succeed.

- #### Servant to the Master
    *Prerequisite: 5th level*

    Your familiar gains additional hit points equal to your warlock level. It gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus, and the DC for any saving throws it provokes increases by an equal amount. The hit points gained from this invocation stack with those gained through other invocations.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheCowl">Pact of the Cowl</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Pact Cowl
| 3rd | Assimilate
| 5th | Cape of Concealment
| 7th | Parachute
| 9th | Misdirecting Mantle

</div>

You want to escape notice of those who threaten you, and are rewarded with a mystical cowl made of otherworldly material from your warlock patron.

If your patron is the Archfey, this could be a cape of pastel silks and gossamers. If you serve the Fiend, your cloak might be made from bat wings and demon hide, while a the Cosmic machine could grant a robe made from fabric with a metallic sheen. If your patron is Death, your cloak could be one from worn grey cloth, almost deathly thin.

### Pact Cowl
You gain a unique, eldritch cowl from your patron. It takes the form of a hooded cloak, cape or robe.

You can spend one ***bonus action*** to summon your Cowl, as long as you do not wear another cloak, and it appears on you equipped.

 **Eldritch Protection**. When using this Cowl and no other armor, you can choose to have a base AC or 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

 **Magical Origin**. It cannot be affected by any magic changing it, including *polymorph object*, unless you allow it.

 **Ephemeral**. The Cowl disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the cowl (no action required), or if you die.

In addition, while wearing your Cowl, you may choose to use your Intelligence modifier in place of Dexterity when you make a Stealth or Sleight of Hand check.

### Assimilate
You can absorb the arcane properties of a magic cloak, cape, or robe into your pact cowl by performing a special, eldritch ritual.

The ritual takes 1 hour, during which all magic properties will be transferred into your pact cowl. The original item looses all magic and becomes mundane. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient item in this way. Whenever you perform this ritual, only the properties of the last assimilated item remain.

### Cape of Concealment
While you are wearing your Cowl, you have advantage on all Stealth checks, and you are constantly under the effects of the *nondetection* spell. You cna choose to suppress the effect at will.

### Parachute
While you are wearing your Cowl, you may cast the *feather fall* spell on yourself at will without expending a spell slot.

### Misdirecting Mantle
If an enemy combatant misses you with a melee attack roll while you are wearing your Cowl, you may use your ***reaction*** to redirect their attack to one creature of your choice. The attacker must roll a new attack roll with advantage against their new target's AC.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all uses after a short rest.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Cowl.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Frozen Fur Lining
  Your Cowl provides unnatural warmth, functioning as cold weather gear and making you comfortable in frigid environments. You gain resistance to cold damage while wearing the Cowl.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheEvilEye">Pact of the Evil Eye</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Hex
| 3rd | Devouring Hex
| 5th | Stealing the Senses
| 7th | Maddening Hex
| 9th | Relentless Hex

</div>

You want to make your enemies suffer, and are gifted with the ability to curse others. Your patron bestows upon you an otherworldly mark somewhere on your body, usually on the palm of one of your hands or on your forehead. This mark is enchanted with ancient and dreaded secrets of curses, known as the Evil eye.

### Hex
You learn the *hex* spell, which does not count against your spells known.

 **Evil Eye**. As an ***action***, you can hide or reveal the mark. While revealed, it acts as an arcane focus. You may cast the *hex* spell once at its lowest level without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

 **Eldritch Retribution**. When the target of your current casting of *hex* deals damage to you, you may use a ***reaction*** to deal the *hex* damage to the target.

 **Hardy**. You may choose to use your Intelligence modifier in place of Constitution when you make a Concentration check. When keeping concentration on the *hex* spell, you always have advantage.

### Devouring Hex
When a creature under the effects of your *hex* is reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to end the spell to regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Intelligence modifier.

### Stealing the Senses
You learn the art of using your curse to surveil and gather information. When you cast the *hex* spell, you can choose to increase the duration to 8 hours. When cast in this way, the spell does not trigger the extra damage from successful attack rolls.

While a target is afflicted by this option, you can sense what direction they are in, though you are unable to discern how far they are from you. Additionally, as long as the target is within one mile, you can use your ***action*** to use one of the targets senses instead of you own, seeing what the target sees, or hearing what the target hears.

### Maddening Hex
As a ***bonus action***, you cause a psychic disturbance around the target cursed by your *hex*. When you do so, you deal psychic damage to the cursed target and each creature of your choice adjacent to it. The psychic damage equals your Intelligence modifier.

You must be able to see the cursed target, and it must be within 30 feet.

### Relentless Hex
Your curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. As a ***bonus action***, you can teleport up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space adjacent to the target cursed by your *hex*. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the target.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Evil Eye.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Curse of the Marionette
    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    Once per casting of *hex*, you may spend an ***action*** to cast *dominate beast* or *dominate person* on the target of the hex, without spending a spell slot. Transferring the *hex* to a new target does not constitute a new casting.

- #### Wretched Mark
    *Prerequisite: 15th level*

    When you see a creature cursed by you making an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the roll. If the attack hits, the cursed creature takes 2d10 psychic damage.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheTalisman">Pact of the Talisman</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Pact Talisman
| 3rd | Eldritch Aegis
| 5th | Dark Seal
| 7th | Reality Tear
| 9th | Destruction

</div>

You want to destroy your enemies, and you are rewarded with a talisman of power. Your talisman may take many different forms depending on your chosen patron; here are some inspirations for your talisman's appearance:

**The Archfey**. Your talisman may appear as an inscribed wand, a petrified leaf worn around the neck, or a ring with the insignia of your patron's court.

**The Fiend**. A talisman from a Fiend may be an unholy symbol, a large fang or blood painted stone.

**The Great Old One**. Your talisman could take many different forms: perhaps a scrap of paper torn from a tome of secrets; a twitching eyeball pendant; or a small flickering lantern.

### Pact Talisman
The talisman acts as a conduit for your eldritch power. As an arcane focus, you can cast your spells through it, but your taliman allows you to do it even if you are not holding it. A spell's range is determined from the location of the talisman instead of your own.

You can target spell effects as normal, if you see the targets. Otherwise, spell cast through your talisman will be unguided, and will instead be cast at a valid target or area nearest to the talisman following the spell's behaviour. If an unguided spell has no valid targets, the spell is wasted.

You can summon this talisman back to your hand as a ***bonus action***. While on the same plane, you always know the distance and direction between you and your talisman.

### Eldritch Aegis
You are always aware of the nature of creatures within 10 ft of your talisman as if it were under the effect of the *detect evil and good* spell.

In addition you can use your ***reaction*** to cast *shield* on a creature holding your talisman without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

### Dark Seal
You can cast the *glyph of warding* and *Nystul's magic aura* spells at your warlock spell slot level on your talisman without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell with this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Reality Tear
You can teleport your talisman to a location you can see within 120 ft of you as an ***action***. If you teleport your talisman into the inventory of an unwilling creature, it must succeed a Perception check contested by your Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check to notice. If the creature succeeds it can avoid this teleportation, causing your talisman to drop to the ground in its space.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

You can project your senses through your talisman as an action, allowing you to perceive creatures and objects up to 30 feet from its location until the end of your next turn, as long as it is on the same plane of existence.

### Destruction
While you are holding the talisman, you can spend an action to cast *disintegrate* as a 6th-level spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Talisman.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Flesh Puppet
    *Prerequisites: 5th level*

    You can place your talisman on the remains of a medium or smaller humanoid, and cause it to rise again as if under the effect of the *animate dead* spell. If the talisman is separated from the undead creature's possession or used to cast another spell, the effect ends and the creature will immediately drop dead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

- #### Trickster's Step
    *Prerequisites: 5th level*

    You can use your ***bonus action*** to swap places with your talisman, as long as it is within 60 feet of you. Alternatively, you can use this feature to swap places with a willing creature holding your talisman within this range. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-PactoftheTome">Pact of the Tome</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pact Features
| Warlock Level | Feature |
|:-------------:|:--------|
| 1st | Book of Shadows
| 3rd | Forbidden Knowledge
| 5th | Page of Eldritch Power
| 7th | Focused Mind
| 9th | Archivist, Fractured Soul

</div>

You ask your patron for forbidden knowledge, and are rewarded with a tome of eldritch secrets called a Book of Shadows. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.

### Book of Shadows
You gain a book of forbidden knowledge from your patron, granting you more power over the arcane. While you are holding your Book of Shadows, you can cast your warlock spells as a ritual if they have the ritual tag.

Your book bears the unmistakable mark of your patron—fiendish red veins, fey vines and flowers, aberrant runes and etchings, etc.

You can summon the book to your hand as a ***action***.

 **Adding Rituals**. When you find a ritual spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up). For each level of the spell, you must spend 2 hours and 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

 **Forbidden Cantrips**. Choose one cantrip from any class spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast that cantrip at will. It doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

 **Forbidden Ritual**. Choose one 1st-level spell that has the ritual tag from any class spell list. The spell appears in the book and doesn't count against the number of spells you know. While the book is in your hand, you can cast that spell as a ritual.

### Forbidden Knowledge
Add two additional cantrips and one additional 1st-level spell that has the ritual tag to your Book of Shadows. These spells can be from any class spell list (and needn't be from the same list).

### Page of Eldritch Power
A new page appears in your Book of Shadows; a page of eldritch power.

 **Adding Names**. A creature may spend an ***action*** to write its true name on the page. The page can contain a number of names equal to your Intelligence modifier. Additional names (or false names) written on the page will fade after one minute.

 **Removing Names**. When you finish a long rest, you may touch one page of power from your Book of Shadows and magically erase any names of your choice.

 **Destroying the Page**. The page naturally heals any damage to it. If the page is torn out of the book, that page turns to ash and a new one appears in the book—exactly as it was.

Choose a power from the options below.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Mind Palace
    You can cast the *sending* spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

    ***The Patron Knows All***. Your patron is fully aware of any message sent or received by your Book of Shadows.

- #### Deathly Note
    When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead.

    Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a long rest.

    ***The Patron's Price***. If a creature dies while their name is written on the page, their soul is claimed by your patron and you regain one expended spell slot.

</div>

### Focused Mind
While you are holding your Book of Shadows, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.

### Archivist
Your Book of Shadows gains another page of eldritch power. Choose a power. You may take the same option multiple times if you wish.

### Fractured Soul
Your Book of Shadows is no longer destroyed when you die, and it can be used in place of your corpse to restore you to life.

### Pact Invocations
The following invocations are unique to warlocks with the Pact of the Tome.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Aspect of the Moon
    You no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading your Book of Shadows and keeping watch.

- #### Dark Knowledge
    Gain 2 skill points to spend on the *Arcana*, *History*, *Nature*, *Religion* or *Medicine* skill, and have advantage making an Intelligence check for these skills, if you spend a full round consulting the book before the check.

- #### Scroll of Imperial Authority
    Whenever you can see a creature charmed by you, you can use your ***bonus action*** to cause it to speak any phrase you wish. The creature thinks that it chose to say those words of its own volition, though they may not believe them to be true.

- #### Shadows Between Pages
    *Prerequisite: 9th level*

    During a long rest, you can perform a ritual to store a spell you know of 5th level or lower into your Book of Shadows. While the book is in your person, as an ***action***, you can cast the stored spell at the lowest possible level it can be cast without expending a spell slot or needing material components. When the spell is cast, when you store a new spell, or when you lose the book, the previous stored spell is lost.

</div>
