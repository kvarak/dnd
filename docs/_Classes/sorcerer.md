# Sorcerer
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

#### Raw Magic
Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.

The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.

#### Unexplained Powers
When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.

Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.

Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.






### Creating a Sorcerer
There are some important questions to consider when creating your sorcerer. They might have been answered during your background generation. If not, make something up, or roll on the Sorcerer background tables available from the DM.

#### Arcane Origin
The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. Some sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.

Does your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn’t know where their power arose from, your DM can select an origin and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.








#### Reaction
When a new sorcerer enters the world, either at birth or later when one’s power becomes evident, the consequences of that event depend greatly on how its witnesses react to what they have seen.

When your powers appeared, how did the world around you respond? Were other people supportive, fearful, or somewhere in between?

#### Sign of Sorcery
As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But even when one’s magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from.

When you casts a spell, does the effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is this sign tied to your origin or some other aspect of who you are, or is it a seemingly random phenomenon?

#### Manifestation
How did your sorcerous powers first manifest? Was there signs already at birth, or did they not appear until later? Maybe when you reached puberty, or during a stressful situation.

#### Spell Slots
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain your 2 lowest expended spell slots after a night’s rest.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from your spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

#### Sorcery Points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain spent sorcery points when you finish long rests.

#### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to regain spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

 **Creating Spell Slots**. You can twist your sorcery into spellpower as a ***bonus action***. You cannot create new spell slots, but you can recover expended spell slots. You may recover multiple spell slots at the same time with a single bonus action, as long as you have enough sorcery points.

<div class="infoarea">

Clanda cursed aloud as the hobgoblin deflected her witch bolt. She felt a chill sweep through her body—the last of her spellpower was now gone.

The hobgoblin sneered in victory, pointing his hooked blade at her. "Out of spells already? Pathetic elf. What are you going to do now, witch?"

"Oh I'm no witch, you poor fool," laughed Clanda, raising a hand to the sky. "I'm a sorceress." She felt alive again as raw, sorcerous power suddenly blazed through her body, restoring her precious spellpower.

The hobgoblin ran. He did not get far.

 **Imbuing Touch**. As an ***action***, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 sorcery points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

 **Sorcerous Fortitude**. As an ***action***, you can spend any number of sorcery points to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain three of the <a href="#internal-metaMagic">Metamagic options</a> of your choice and gain three additional options at both 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

- **<a href="#internal-ashen">Ashen Lineage</a>**. Somewhere in your bloodline, one of your ancestors made a pact with a powerful spirit of flame and predation known as the Ashen Wolf.

Let your power burn forth like wildfire

- **<a href="#internal-autumnal">Autumnal Spirit</a>**. You are a sorcerer who wields the power of cold, decay, and bountiful harvests. Your powers could have originated from an entity of death and decay, or from a powerful god of harvest.

Whatever the case may be, you are a wielder of the magics that surround the season of autumn.

For generations, the taint of Ooze blood has run in your family, infecting some at birth and sparing others, stemming from a well-documented but shadowy ancestor.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-aberrant">Aberrant bloodline</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Aberrant bloodline features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Dark Whisperer, Tainted Blood
| 6th | Mindfire
| 14th | Aberrant Form
| 18th | Xenomorphic Apotheosis

</div>

Somewhere in your bloodline, your ancestors were tainted by an aberration. Whether as subjects to experiments from mind flayers, slaves to dreadful aboleths or beholders, or misshapen slaadi who failed to completely transform.

This taint in your blood is alien and bizarre. You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle that most would not expect. Over time, this taint manifests itself in your physical form, like claws, webbed feet, an extra eye, or slimy skin.

### Dark Whisperer
Many creatures of your heritage seldom communicate orally, relying on greater mental powers to touch the minds of similar or lesser beings. From 1st level, you can communicate telepathically with a creature you can see within 30 feet. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Additionally, you learn the *vicious mockery* cantrip.

### Tainted Blood
The magic in your veins makes you resilient to toxins and alien substances. From 1st level, you gain resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition.

In addition, you are proficient with intimidating humanoids and beasts.

### Mindfire
Starting at 6th level, you add *detect thoughts*, *dissonant whispers*, and *suggestion* as spells known if you do not already know them.

Additionally, you learn to channel your sorcerous energies to emit a potent psychic energy in a 30-foot cone. As an ***action*** you can spend a number of sorcery points up to half your Sorcerer level. Each creature in the area must succeed an Intelligence saving throw with DC equal to your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes psychic damage equal to 1d4 per sorcery point spent plus your Charisma modifier and are stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not stunned.



### Aberrant Form
Starting 14th level, you learn to embrace your tainted heritage and can channel your magic to embody a powerful aberration. As an ***action***, you can spend 6 sorcery points to transform yourself as if you had cast the *polymorph* spell. You follow the normal rules of the spells except you can only transform into aberrations and do not gain the benefits of the shapechanger subtype or feature. Whenever you revert back to your true form (whether intentional or not), you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, you are dealt 4d8 psychic damage and afflicted with a short-term madness (DMG, pg. 259). This psychic damage cannot be prevented from immunities or resistances.

### Xenomorphic Apotheosis
At 18th level, your physical form has become twisted by the taint of your ancestors, allowing your psionic capabilities to reach their full potential. You gain resistance to psychic damage.

Whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, as a ***reaction*** by expending 2 sorcery points, you can treat it as a Charisma saving throw instead.

Additionally, whenever you cast a spell at 1st-level or higher that deals psychic damage, you add your Charisma modifier to it.

</div>

To many, even the sight of spiders can instill fear into the hearts of others. However, you have learned to not only to instill this fear, but also to use the power of spiders as well. You are a sorcerer who has mastered the might and abilities of spiders, manipulating other creatures and web alike.

Perhaps you were bitten by a magical spider, or your birth was affected by magical abilites from Lolth. Whatever the case may be, you are a frightening and powerfully skilled sorcerer.

#### Arachnid Magic Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | You have several sets of eyes, some larger and some smaller.
| 2 | Eating bugs is a common occurrence for you.
| 3 | You have incredibly patience, and can wait in one spot for a long period of time before what you are expecting to happen occurs.
| 4 | People often look upon you with fear in your appearance, but many still respect your abilities and wisdom.
| 5 | Small fangs protrude from your mouth, and your teeth are sharp.
| 6 | You care very deeply for young children, and often try to help in protecting them.

### Spider Movement
At 1st level, your familiarity with spiders has allowed you to communicate with them. You ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing. You also are able to speak to spiders as if under the *speak with animals* spell.

### Vicious Constitution
Beginning at 1st level, you have become accustomed to the venom within a spider’s fangs, and can even use it yourself. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws against poison. You also learn the *poison spray* or *venom strike* cantrip.

Additionally, your gender lends you additional benefits. If you are a female, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. If you are a male, your movement speed increases by 5 feet. If your character has no gender, then you may choose between these two.



### Web Familiarity
By 6th level, you have become adept at moving like a spider. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Additionally, you are now able to call upon your spider allies to aid you. As an ***action***, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast *conjure animals*, though you are only able to summon giant wolf spiders, swarm of spiders, or giant spiders.

### Heightened Webbing
At 14th level, you have heightened your webbing skills. While in contact with a web, you know the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web, and your movement speed is doubled when moving on webs.

Additionally, as a ***reaction*** to falling, you can shoot a strand of webbing towards a wall or ceiling to stop you from falling. This webbing has a maximum range of 100 feet, and can withstand up to 200 lbs of weight before the web breaks. You can climb up this web with a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.

### Den of the Widow
By 18th level, your spider-like constitution has granted you immunity to the poisoned condition. You also gain the ability to transform any area into your domain. As an ***action***, you can spend 6 sorcery points to devour a small spider, then spew forth from your throat large amounts of webbing, which works as if you cast the spell web. However, the spell has the following changes:
* The spell’s range covers that of a 90 foot cube.
* The webbing has resistance to fire damage.
* The spell does not require concentration.
* While moving on this webbing, you and any spiders you summon have their movement speed increased by 10 feet.
* The webbing lasts for 1 minute, at which point the webbing wilts away.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Somewhere in your bloodline, one of your ancestors made a pact with a powerful spirit of flame and predation known as the Ashen Wolf. This elemental creature is neither fiend nor fey, but something primal and otherworldly. It is honored with ritualistic immolation and sacrifices of meat and metal.

While the Wolf may have no hold over you, it may be interested in your affairs nevertheless, and your very existence could draw the ire of the Wolf’s eternal foe: the frost-bound Wild Huntsman. With smoke and cinders pouring from your hands with each spell you cast and a layer of ash gradually creeping over your body, you are the incarnation of a smoldering ember thrown upon a dry forest. Let your power burn forth like wildfire

### Born of Ember
At 1st level, a thin layer of ash and charred wood begins to coat your skin as you fight, engulfing you, yet allowing you to blaze back to life with a vengeance. Whenever you are below your hit point maximum, charred claws and fangs erupt from your hands and mouth. While you have these claws, you can use your ***bonus action*** to make a melee spell attack that deals fire damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, the damage increases to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier.

The first time after a long rest when you are below half your hit point maximum, the ash that coats your body infuses your soul, granting you gain resistance to fire damage. This lasts until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you learn the *produce flame* cantrip.

### Burning Fury
Starting at 6th level, the fire within you begins to call directly to the Ashen Wolf, and it grants you strength, either in honor of your ancestor or in a twisted form of revenge. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack granted by your Born of Ember class feature, the burning fury empowering your attack surges through the creature, turning its vital organs to ash and granting you temporary hit points equal to your Sorcerer level.

Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point during your turn when you are below half your hit point maximum to cause the ash upon your skin to harden. For i minute, your AC is 17. This has no effect if your AC is equal to or greater than 17.



### Cinderwraith
At 14th level, your spark has grown to a flame, burning black with dark power. Any time you would inflict fire damage, you can choose to inflict necrotic damage instead, and vice versa.

Additionally, your ashen form allows you to move with unnatural ease, disintegrating and reforming with each step you take. You ignore difficult terrain, and you can move through any space at least 6 inches wide without squeezing.

### The Wolf’s Bargain
At 18th level, your strength has grown to surpass that of your ancestor, and your power over the ancient and primal magics of flame and ash is without peer. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to launch yourself skyward in a pillar of fire and smoke before crashing down at a location that you can see within 60 feet of your point of origin, unleashing a hellish blast of fire and cursed power at creatures within 10 feet of you. The targets must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. They take 6d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If any targets are slain by this attack, they are consumed instantly by flame, and the ashes coalesce into a hellhound. Hell hounds summoned by this feature are elementals instead of fiends. The hellhound obeys your orders without question and acts during your turn. You can’t have more than two hellhounds at a time from this feature. Creation of a third hellhound destroys the oldest one still alive. Each hellhound remains in your service until slain or until the third dawn after it was summoned, at which point it disintegrates into Ash.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

<div class="featuresTable">

#### Autumnal Spirit features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | One With the Fall, Knowledge of Harvests
| 6th | Guardians of the Fields
| 14th | Cloak of Fallen Leaves
| 18th | Wrathful Storm of Autumn

</div>

The season of autumn is a curious one; the season brings people together, to celebrate successful harvests and rejoice in festivals, but it also is a reminder that all things will slowly meet their end and wither away to bring life to something new. Yet even with this process, there is beauty and joy to be found in the passing of life into death, as the cold snaps away at once were warm, summer days.

You are a sorcerer who wields the power of cold, decay, and bountiful harvests, and as such are both a welcome ally and a powerful foe. Your powers could have originated from an entity of death and decay, or from a powerful god of harvest. Or, perhaps your bloodline stems from a culture that relishes in the season of autumn, and are keepers of crops. Whatever the case may be, you are a wielder of the magics that surround the season of autumn.

#### Autumnal Spirit Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | Your eyes are orange, auburn, deep brown, yellow, or grey in color.
| 2 | Many call upon you to be present during a harvest, as if you are a good luck charm.
| 3 | You smell like cinnamon, pumpkins, apples, hay, apples, damp wood, or fallen leaves.
| 4 | You are a rather melancholy individual.
| 5 | When you are near trees, they will shed a few of their leaves, as if in autumn.
| 6 | You are always ready to plan or attend a festival.

### One With the Fall
By 1st level, you are attuned to nature. You gain proficiency with the Nature skill, and you learn the *druidcraft* cantrip.

### Knowledge of Harvests
Starting at 1st level, your experience with harvests and preparing feasts has granted you additional benefits. You gain proficiency with sickles and scythes, and can use one as an arcane focus.

In addition, once per day, you may spend an hour scouring the land for edible crops, such as fruits and vegetables. By doing so, you are able to produce a small amount of food that works as if you had cast the spell *goodberry*.



### Guardians of the Fields
By 6th level, you have become accustomed to the cooler climates of autumn, and the natural states of decay that autumn brings. You gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage.

Additionally, you can call upon the guardians of harvests to come to your aid. As an ***action***, you toss into the air a handful of straw or hay, spending 3 sorcery points to summon a number of scarecrows (Monster Manual, pg. 268) equal to your proficiency bonus. The maximum number of scarecrows you may have at any given time is equal to your proficiency bonus.

These scarecrows obey your commands, and act on your initiative order. These scarecrows exist until they are reduced to 0 hit points or are dispelled as a ***bonus action***.

### Cloak of Fallen Leaves
By 14th level, the plants of the land have become your ally. You can cast *speak with plants* at will.

Additionally, as a ***bonus action***, you may summon a cloak of fallen leaves to wrap around you. While wearing this cloak, once on each of your turns, you can use 10 feet of your movement to step into one living tree and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

### Wrathful Storm of Autumn
At 18th level, you may create a mighty storm of autumn, filled with chilling air, dense fog, and fallen leaves. As an ***action***, you can spend 5 sorcery points to create a powerful force of whirling, cold wind centered in a 20 foot radius centered on you, and reaching about 15 feet in height. This storm lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration.

While active, this storm has the following effects on creatures other than you:
* When the storm is first summoned, creatures within it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 20 feet out of the storm.
* Howling winds filled with chilling air and fallen autumn leaves whirl around you. Creatures who are within this area suffer 4d8 cold damage and 4d8 slashing damage as the cold winds and sharp leaves batter them.
* Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.
* Creatures within the storm move at half their normal speed as the chilling air and fog make navigation difficult.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Your innate magic stems from the corrupting power of a Gulthias tree. Most with this origin can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by a blighted creature, or through extended exposure to blighted land and plant life. Attempting to consume blighted plants over a period of a few weeks or months can often lead to this magic becoming imbued into a creature’s system, assuming it doesn’t kill them first. Whatever the cause, blight magic allows you to animate blighted creatures to do your bidding, as if you were a living Gulthias tree.

### Blighted Construct
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you gain the ability to animate a plant to do your bidding. As an ***action***, you can touch a pile of twigs and infuse it with blighted magic, awakening it as a twig blight. This blight cannot attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

While the blight is within 150 feet of you, you can mentally command it to move (no action required). Additionally, as an ***action***, you can see and hear through the blight until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You may only have one twig blight animated with this feature at a time.

### Rotting Touch
Also from 1st level, your touch can rot objects and plants. As an ***action***, you can touch a Small or smaller plant or object made from plant material. The target slowly rots over the next minute as if a year had passed. This feature can only be used once on any one plant or object.



### Awakening
At 6th level, you gain the ability to awaken plants into needle blights. With a 1 minute long ritual, you can touch an area of plant life and expend 3 sorcery points to imbue it with foul magic, awakening it as a needle blight. Blights that you create have their hit point maximum increased by an amount equal to your sorcerer level, and they add your proficiency modifier to their attack and damage rolls.

On each of your turns, you can use a ***bonus action*** to mentally command any creature you made with this feature if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

Once you complete a long rest, the creatures created using this feature fall apart, returning to their original form.

### Blighted Command
Beginning at 14th level, you can create vine blights in much the same way you create needle blights. Following the same rules as outlined in the awakening feature, you can awaken a vine blight by expending 4 sorcery points.

Vine blights can be commanded in the same way as needle blights, except you can command them from up to 500 feet away. You can choose to have any needle blights within 60 feet of a vine blight receive the same command.

### Unrelenting Army
Beginning at 18th level, you can imbue life into back into your blights after they have fallen. As an ***action***, you can touch a blight that was reduced to 0 hit points within the last minute and spend 1 sorcery point to revive it with half of its hit point maximum in current hit points.

To many, sands of the earth or deserts are viewed as a nuisance; it is coarse, rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere. However you have a unique and immense power over sand, and are a perfect being for surviving the trials and mirages of the desert. Perhaps you were born amongst the dunes of an ancient desert, the magic of the sands having spoken to you. Or, you came into contact with a mirage, peculiar plant, or ancient ruin within a desert, and your magic awoke from the interaction you had with it. However your powers emerged for you, you are a valuable traveling companion and a spirit of the very desert itself.

#### Dune Child Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | You always seem to have parts of you that are covered in a thin layer of sand.
| 2 | It is shameful to waste any form of resource, especially necessities.
| 3 | Scales, small spikes, or rough hide might be covering your skin.
| 4 | You never go on any journey without the right supplies.
| 5 | Sweat is something you have never had to deal with.
| 6 | You always carry some container filled with sand or dirt.

### One of the Desert
Beginning at 1st level, you have become accustomed to the extreme conditions and landscapes of the deserts. You are proficient with surviving in the wild. You're also naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by deserts or pits of sand.

### Magic of the Dunes
At 1st level, your familiarity with the desert sands has allowed you to learn when to alter it, and when to know if the heat is playing tricks with your mind. You learn the *air mastery* cantrip, and you have advantage on checks made to identify illusions.

### Shield of the Sands
By 6th level, you have acclimated to the heats of the desert, as well as the venomous animals and poisonous plants that reside within it. You gain resistance to fire and poison damage.

Additionally, you may call upon the sands of the desert to shield you from incoming blows. As an ***action***, you can spend 3 sorcery points to create a magical shield of swirling sand on yourself that lasts until you start a long rest. The sand shield has hit points equal to twice your sorcerer level. Whenever you take damage, the sand shield takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the sand shield has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. On your turn, if you spend no movement and stand on ground composed of sand, dirt, or loose stone, the sand shield regains a number of hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.

Once you create the sand shield, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Illusions of the Waste
At 14th level, your are familiar with the mirages of the desert, as well as knowing how to use illusions to aid you. You have advantage on saving throws against illusion spells.

Additionally, you may cast the spell *blur* or *mirror image* once each, without requiring concentration.

### Master of the Desolation
By 18th level, you have garnered mastery over the desert, allowing you to call upon its strength anywhere. As an ***action***, you can spend 5 sorcery points to create a sandstorm in a 30 foot radius sphere centered on you, and it moves with you. While this sandstorm is active, creatures caught within the affected area take slashing damage equal to half your sorcerer level at the beginning of each of their turns, and their movement speed is reduced by half. In addition, creatures within the affected area have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist illusion spells that you cast.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

</div>


</div>

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

### Divine Magic
Choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

| Affinity | Spell |
|:--|:---|
| Good | *cure wounds* |
| Evil | *inflict wounds* |
| Law | *bless* |
| Chaos | *bane* |
| Neutrality | *protection from evil and good* |

In addition, your spells count as divine spells instead of arcane spells

### Favored by the Gods
Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short  rest.




### Empowered Healing
Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells.

Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can usa ***reaction*** and spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

### Otherworldly Wings
Starting at 14th level, you can use a ***bonus action*** to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a ***bonus action***.

The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

### Unearthly Recovery
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a ***bonus action*** when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-draconic">Draconic Bloodline</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Draconic Bloodline features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:--:|:---|
| 1st | Dragon Ancestor, Draconic Resilience
| 6th | Elemental Affinity
| 14th | Dragon Wings
| 18th | Draconic Presence

</div>

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

### Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|:--|:--|
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Cold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

You can understand Draconic, and you are proficient with Charisma check when interacting with dragons.

### Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.



### Elemental Affinity
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage. Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a ***bonus action***. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a ***bonus action***.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

### Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an ***action***, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet.

For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

You are a creature of death, a being whose magical powers hold sway over the undead and other necromantic abilities. Your lineage might be intertwined with some vile curse, shaping the living slowly over towards the dead. Perhaps you were the servant to a powerful lich, whose power shaped you forever. Or, you may have had an experience with death, whether it was your own or that of another, and the experience changed your very being.unleashed.

Whatever the case may be, you are a sorcerer who maintains magical skills over death, the undead, and the necromantic energies that empower them.

#### Dread Sorcery Quirks
The power of necromantic magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the following table to create a unique quirk for your character.

| d10 | Quirk |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | You are always icy cold to the touch. |
| 2 | When you are sleeping, you appear as if you are dead.
| 3 | You never seem to sweat, even when pushed to your physical limit.
| 4 | Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you. |
| 5 | You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently. |
| 7 | You are incredibly thin, and people can see the outlines of your bones.
| 8 | Your eyes are a dull, lifeless color, and may not appear to move.
| 9 | Your scars never fully heal, and sometimes appear to stay exposed.


### Grave Return
Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to kill. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.



### Undead Sympathy
Also as 1st level, though you are a living creature, the magic flowing through you grants you many traits of an undead. You are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against poison.

In addition, you are proficient with Charisma check when interacting with undead.

### Undead Strength
At 6th level, your connection to the dead has hardened your body. You gain resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage. You learn the spell *speak with dead*, and it does not

In addition, whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, such as *animate dead*, it has additional benefits:
* The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your sorcerer level.
* The creature adds your proficiency bonus on saving throws against any effect that would turn the undead.
* Whenever the creature reduces another creature to 0 hit points within 15 feet of you, you regain 1 sorcery point. This increases to 30 feet at 14th level.

### One of the Dead
By 14th level, your undead nature has granted you immunity to being frightened, and you also do not need to eat or drink anymore, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.

Additionally, undead creatures sense your connection to them and the dead and become hesitant to attack you. When an undead creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

### Death’s Master
At 18th level, you no longer require sleep, and can’t be forced to sleep by any means. You age much slower than normal. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

Additionally, you have learned how to command the magic of death. Choose two necromancy spells of 5th level or lower from any spell list. You learn those spells, and you can cast each of these spells once without using a spell slot.

In some places in the world, the spectral forms of spirits, ghosts, and banshees reside, subject to the torment of an afterlife undeserved, or having been cursed to never truly rest. Your innate magic is tied to one of these ethereal creatures, and it is through some circumstance that it awakened within you.

Perhaps you almost died, but something in your mind or body held you back from the near brink of death. Another cause could have been the exposure to a place with angry, vengeful, or mournful spirits, whose magic rubbed off on you by choice or by proxy. Slowly, over time, you become more and more like a spirit yourself, and your sorcerous power grows from this transformation.

#### Ethereal Spirit Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | When others look at you, they swear they can partly see through you.
| 2 | You tend to appear as though you float or glide when you walk and run.
| 3 | When you speak, your voice seems to echo quickly before and after you’re done talking.
| 4 | You are drawn to those places that are haunted, hoping to help cleanse it or help the spirits there.
| 5 | The death of even those you only met once hits you hard.
| 6 | You have a voice in your head of another spirit that you had met, who, while not controlling you, uses your body as a host, whether you like it or not.

### Ghost Sight
Beginning at 1st level, your familiarity with ghosts, spirits, and spectres has allowed you to see into their world. You are able to see invisible undead creatures up to 15 feet from you.

In addition, you are proficient with Charisma check when interacting with incorporeal undead.

### Frightening Visage
At 1st level, you have learned to project a frightening, spectral image of yourself between your and an attacking enemy. When attacked by a creature within 30 feet that you can see, you can use your ***reaction*** to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. A creature that cannot frightened is immune to this effect.

You can use this feature once, and regain its use when you finish a short rest.



### Spectral Movement
By 6th level, you have learned how to move through objects and people like a spirit. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You also have learned how to step into the Ethereal Plane in small amounts of time. As a ***bonus action***, you can enter into the Ethereal Plane until the beginning of your next turn. While using this feature, you are visible on the Material Plane while you are in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, however you cannot affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Cry of the Banshee
At 14th level, your familiarity to ghosts and spirits has enabled you become accustomed to their sight. You gain immunity to the frightened condition.

Additionally, you can channel the wailing moans of fright towards your enemies. As an ***action***, you can release a mournful wail, provided that you are not in sunlight. All creatures not constructs and undead within 20 feet of you, that can hear you, must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failure they take psychic damage equal to your sorcerer level and are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. On a successful save they take half damage and are frightened until the beginning of their next turn.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Ghostly Possession
By 18th level, your body has become attuned to the Ethereal Plane, making you more ghost than mortal. You no longer require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Additionally, you are able to possess other creatures, taking control of their bodies. As an ***action***, you can spend 10 sorcery points to possess a target. Choose one humanoid that you can see within 10 feet of you. This target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or become possessed by you. You then disappear, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.








You now control the body but this effect doesn't deprive the target of awareness. You can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead or affect your mind. You use the possessed target's physical stats, however you do not gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

This possession lasts until the target’s body drops to 0 hit points, you end this effect as a ***bonus action***, or you are turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, you reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

Your innate magic comes from fiendish power that can be traced back to the Abyss or the Nine Hells of Baator, power infused into your blood or that of your ancestors. Such power most often manifests itself as the result of a pact or bargain made with a powerful fiend, such as a Pit Fiend or a Balor. You may have endured a near death experience at the hands of a fiend and been forever tainted by the encounter, or perhaps your bloodline includes a powerful Tiefling whose ancestry has manifested in an unusual way. Regardless of circumstance, fell power now surges through you, both a blessing and a curse. While your fate is still your own, you can’t help but wonder if your ultimate reward is bound to the Abyss.


### Fiendish Bloodline
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you choose either the Abyssal or Infernal bloodline. Your choice determines aspects of features as you level up, as well as which quirks table to roll on (should you choose to use any).

#### Fiendish Quirks (Abyssal Bloodline)
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | People swear that you smell slightly of sulfur.
| 2 | You have an extra set of eyes, fingers, toes, or additional teeth.
| 3 | You don’t fear death, demons, or harm done to yourself at all.
| 4 | Those who don’t fear you definitely should.
| 5 | Animals tend to shun you and stay away from you if they can.
| 6 | You have a great respect for those who wield and command power.

#### Fiendish Quirks (Infernal Bloodline)
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | You respect order and a chain of command.
| 2 | Those who are weak must submit to the will and commands of the strong.
| 3 | It is better to have some form of ambition than none at all.
| 4 | A person’s temptations are the best way to manipulate them.
| 5 | Your voice sounds frightening, yet eloquent.
| 6 | You have sharp teeth, cat like eyes, a tail, or long claws.



### Demonic/Devilish Nature
At 1st level, the demonic or devilish magic that resides within you has altered parts of you and your nature. You have advantages when using one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Persuasion, or Intimidation.

In addition, you are proficient with Charisma check when interacting with demons (if you chose the Abyssal bloodline) or devils (if you chose the Infernal bloodline).

### Darkened Sight
At 1st level, your vision is almost like that of a fiend. You can see in dim light within 120 feet as if it were bright light.

Additionally, you can use an action to see through magical and mundane darkness up to 30 feet for 1 minute. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Fiendish Resilience
At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire and poison damage.

Additionally, your skin hardens and darkens to a deep reddish hue, while not wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

### Vile Wings
At 14th level, you have learned how to spring forth vile wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. These wings can appear like those of a winged demon or devil, such as a balor or a horned devil. You can create these wings as a ***bonus action***. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a ***bonus action***.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

#### Hellfire (Abyssal Bloodline)
At 18th level, you can call down a column of hellfire. The area of effect for this ability is a cylinder with 10-foot-radius burst and 30 feet tall. This column deals 1d6 points of fire damage per sorcerer level to creatures in this area. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Dexterity save for half damage. Non evil creatures that fail their saves are frightened for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level

You may use this ability twice per long rest.

#### Will of Asmodeus (Infernal Bloodline)
At 18th level, you take on the inscrutable nature of the Lord of the Ninth himself. Any magic or ability that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

Additionally, you can use the full force of your infernal magic to impose your will on a creature that would otherwise do you harm. When you are targeted by an attack or spell, you can use your ***reaction*** and spend 5 sorcery points to force the attacking creature to make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you can choose to have the creature immediately move up to its speed and perform the attack or spell against a new target of your choice. While charmed, the creature uses your spell save DC in place of its own.

The season of winter brings forth a time of cold winds, hibernation, and grey skies. Most of the land lies under blankets of white snow, and as the days shorten only the strongest and fiercest animals and people even dare to thrive amidst the cold.

Legends tell of an ancient queen whose cruelty was so great that the gods turned her heart into ice. Her power, terrible and beautiful, has manifested within you. Perhaps you are a descendant of the Ice Queen, perhaps you came in contact with a magical relic from the deep north, or maybe you had been raised by a clan living in the frozen north, cursed by a magician who learn ice magic.

Whatever the case, you are a sorcerer who controls the might of winter, with the power of ice and howling winds at your fingertips.

> *"Let it go."*
>
> -- Ice queen Elsa


#### Frozen Heart Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | Your skin is always icy to the touch.
| 2 | Whenever you breathe, you can always see the air escape you as if you are in cold climates.
| 3 | Your hair and skin are an almost snow-white in color.
| 4 | There are always small chunks of ice in your hair or on your body, regardless of surrounding temperature.
| 5 | You have very thick, shaggy hair or fur.
| 6 | When you walk on natural terrain such as grass or plants, the ground and plants ice over in your footsteps.


### Frigid Soul
Propelled by a heart of ice, the blood in your veins runs cold. At 1st level, you’re naturally adapted to cold climates and and can move across difficult terrain made of ice or snow without expending extra movement.

In addition, you have resistance to cold damage.

### Wintertouched
Frozen magic comes as naturally as breathing. At 1st level, you learn the *ray of frost* cantrip.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with a spell that deals cold damage, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This increases to 10 feet at 14th level.



### Flashfreeze
Starting at 6th level, you can use your ***action*** and spend 2 sorcery points to create a simple object or structure made of ice, such as a stairway, a sword, or a solid block. It must reside within a 10 foot cube centered on a point within 120 feet of you. You can't shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area, but you can create walls.

Alternatively, you can turn areas of water to ice within a 40 foot cube centered on a point within 120 feet of you. You cannot freeze areas of water that would trap a creature in ice.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

#### The Nature of Ice
The ice that you create is abnormally cold and dense, but it isn't magical. At room temperature, it melts at a rate of 1 ft every 8 hours.

Each 5 ft square section of ice has AC 10, 20 hp, and vulnerability to fire damage. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hp destroys it.

</div>

### Frostbite
Your frost cuts deep into muscle, making your foes sluggish and occasionally freezing them in their tracks.

Also beginning at 6th level, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature with a spell of 1st level or greater, you may add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt. At the same time you may use a ***bonus action*** to apply one of the following additional effects to that spell:
* **Freeze** - Spend 2 sorcery points to make one target of the spell become frozen in ice. That creatures is grappled until it breaks free; the DC to escape this grapple is equal to your spell save DC.
* **Frostbite** - Spend 3 sorcery points to make one target of the spell become locked in unnaturally-cold ice. That creatures is grappled until it breaks free; the DC to escape this grapple is equal to your spell save DC. Until the creature breaks free from this effect, it is vulnerable to cold damage.

### Frozen Mobility
At 14th level, your power over ice can be used to help you move about the land and air. As an action, you can summon ice to emerge from beneath you, lifting you off the ground and into the air. While maintaining concentration, you can use this ice to maneuver you through the air as if you had a flying speed equal to your movement speed, so long as at least one of your feet maintains a connection to the ice. Whenever your feet leave the ice, the ice starts melting instantly, just as regular ice would.








### Glacial Wreath
Also from 14th level, you can conjure sheaths of ice to protect yourself. Whenever an attack roll against you succeeds, you can use your ***reaction*** and spend 1 sorcery point to gain temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level, which takes effect before you take damage.

Additionally, you can use your action to encase yourself in a protective cocoon of ice for 1 minute or until you choose to end the effect. You become petrified and gain temporary hit points equal to twice your sorcerer level at the start of your turns which last until the effect ends. You are still aware of your surroundings, however.

Once you encase yourself in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Call of Winter
By 18th level, your connection to the chills of winter has grants you resistance to fire damage.

You are able to call upon winter itself to aid you in battle. As an ***action***, you can spend 10 sorcery points to coat a 100 foot area with winter weather; ice frosts over many objects, snow begins to fall from grey clouds that form 50 feet above you, and chilling winds blow throughout the area. For 1 minute, the affected area has the following effects:
* Creatures who do not move on their turn must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have half of their body freeze over, becoming grappled until the beginning of their next turn. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of their next turn.
* Creatures with vulnerability to cold damage automatically take cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier at the beginning of each of their turns.
* Any mundane fires, such as those from torches, fire pits, or sconces, are automatically put out when this effect begins.
* Any bodies of water freeze over, and become difficult terrain
* A hostile creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage and become restrained until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

These rare and mysterious individuals have unique spells and a dweomercraft all their own.  They are especially adept at countering and negating the magics of other spellcasting creatures and individuals, and at dealing with creatures who exist simultaneously on more than one plane (such as certain undead).

Incantatrix, whose male equivalent is the Incantatar, study and shape spells in their raw effects and can modify the spells of allies, magic items and even active spells cast by another. They dislike extraplanar intrusions, having a particular fondness for magic that thwarts extraplanar beings while seeking out and destroying planar portals and gates.

> *"But how could a mere wizard defeat the Archmage with a spell so beyond her powers?" asked the sage skeptically.*
>
> *"It is said," replied the teller-of-tales in a low, guarded voice, "that she stole the spell from his own mind!"*
>
> *"Impossible!" sputtered the sage.*
>
> *The other shook his head slowly. "No, my friend," he corrected the learned one. "Not for an incantatrix."*



### Ectoplasmic Spells
At 1st level, your spells breach the gulf between dimensions, sending ghostly emanations into the ether. Your spells have full effect against incorporeal or ethereal creatures.

### Cooperative Metamagic
At 3rd level, when you gain access to metamagic, you have the ability to apply any metamagic you possess to a spell being cast by a willing allied spellcaster. You must be adjacent to the other caster, use a ***reaction*** and succeed at a Arcana check, with a DC equal to the 3 times the spell's level. If you succeed, spend the sorcery point cost as if you had used the metamagic yourself.

### Cooperative Metamagic: Persistent Spells
At 6th level, you can apply your 3rd level cooperative metamagic feature to a persistent spell effect that is already in place.

For example, you could use Extend Spell to extend the duration of a wall of force or Empowered Spell to change the damage dealt by a *cloudkill*.



### Seize Concentration
At 6th level, you gain the ability to wrest control of a spell that requires concentration from another spellcaster within 30 feet. If the target spellcaster is willing, this transfer of concentration occurs automatically. Otherwise, you make a spell attack against your opponent's spell save DC. If you are trying to seize control of a divine spell, your attack roll is made with disadvantage.

If you win, you gain control of the spell for as long as you maintain concentration or until the original spell duration expires. The spell functions as though you were the caster, except that any variables determined when the spell was cast remain as determined by the original caster.

The original spellcaster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives advantage on any saving throw allowed against it. If you allow your concentration to lapse before the spell duration expires, the original caster may reassert control over his spell by making a successful spell attack against your spell save DC. If he fails to do so, no one controls the spell.

### Cooperative Metamagic: Items
At 14th level, you gain the ability to apply your 3rd level cooperative metamagic to the effect of a spell trigger item (generally wands). To use this ability you must be the one using the item and make a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check, with a DC equal to 3 times the spell level. If you succeed, spend the sorcery point cost as if you had used the metamagic yourself.

If the item requires attunement, you must be attuned to use cooperative metamagic.

### Drain Magic
At 14th level, you gain an ability to drain magic from an item or device that has charges, and use that magical force to restore your own vitality. This power does not work on a item that has no charges, nor on an artifact or relic. For each charge drained from an item, you roll one of your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier, adding to your current hit point total, without spending one of your own Hit Dice.

To use this power, you must remain still, holding the item to be drained with bare hand or hands, for one minute per charge drained.








### Stealspell
At 18th level, you gain the power to steal spells from your opponent's mind. This powerful magic is famous in legend, and the one power that above all others identifies the incantatrix as a person of special powers.

By means of this power, you target any single being who is within 60 feet. To steal a spell, you need to make an spell attack roll against your opponent's spell save DC. If you are trying to steal a divine spell, your attack roll is made with disadvantage. If you succeed, you steal a spell from the mind of the victim. The stolen spell is determined randomly. The magic of the stealspell works even against a victim who is unconscious or insane; psionic protections, anti-magic shell and all similar shielding spells, are all powerless against this ability.

A stolen spell may be cast immediately, without material components or even any need for you to understand the spell. You will not automatically know the identity or the nature of the stolen spell so you may end up aiding rather than harming an opponent. Any stolen spell takes effect, when expelled, as though it was cast by the being from which it was stolen, with regard to level of effectiveness, damage caused, alignment considerations, and so forth. Spell-like natural powers employed by beings cannot be stolen by means of this spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

</div>

</div>

The powers of the sea, much like the sea itself, are vast, mysterious, and powerful. You are a sorcerer of the oceans and seas, having power over their waters and the creatures who live inside of them. Your family could have been filled with powerful sailors or beings of the depths, or maybe you almost drowned, and this awakened great magics that had lied dormant within you. Or, it could be that your bloodline somehow originated in the Elemental Plane of Water.  Whatever the case may be, the magic that exists at your command is a powerful force, and can easily be one of the strongest forms of magic that exists.

#### Oceanic Bloodline Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | Something of the sea, such as barnacles, seaweeds, coral, fins, or scales, are on parts of your body.
| 2 | Your fingers and toes are webbed, and you have gills on your neck.
| 3 | The great beasts of the sea are to be both feared and respected.
| 4 | The world, much like the seas, is both beautiful and unpredictable.
| 5 | You prefer to carry some containers of fresh and salt water with you at all time.
| 6 | Like the oceans of the world, the way you are deep inside might not be how you appear on the surface.


### Command Water
Starting at 1st level, you learn the *water whip* cantrip and the *shape water* cantrip. The cantrips don't count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast *shape water*, you can choose two effects to activate with a single casting of the spell. You may choose the following effect as one of them:
* Create up to 1 gallon of ocean water within range. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 5-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

### Creature of the Seas
Also from 1st level, you are accustomed to living in or near the water. You gain a swim speed equal to your base speed, and you can spend 1 sorcery point to breathe water for 1 hour.

#### Special Effects
The special effects of numerous spells can be altered to appear watery in origin. For example, *burning hands* can instead be superheated steam. *Shield* may be a solidified disk of water. With the DM's permission, you could also alter the damage type of a spell to reflect this origin.

For example, the *water whip* cantrip below is simply the *thornwhip* druid cantrip with the piercing damage changed to bludgeoning. Bludgeoning and cold are appropriate damage exchanges, but oceanic sorcerers also control weather, so wind-like effects, lightning and thunder are also appropriate.

<div class="spell">

##### Water Whip
*Transmutation cantrip*<br/>
 **Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
 **Range:** 30 feet<br/>
 **Components:** V, S, M (a splash of water)<br/>
 **Duration:** Instantaneous<br/>

You create a long, whip-like tendril of water that lashes out  at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

</div>

### Strength of the Tides
At 6th level, your watery nature has granted you increased protection. You gain resistance to fire and acid damage.

In addition, you have learned how to summon water to hinder your foes. When you see a target within 30 feet of you make an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to summon a wall of water in front of the target to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

At 14th level, the range increases to 60 feet.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.


### Shifting Form
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to enter a semi-liquid state while moving. You have advantage on Dexterity checks made against being grappled, and when you move on your turn, you have resistance to damage from opportunity attacks.

On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you're in a space one size smaller than you. You can't willingly stop in a space that is smaller than that, and if you're forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space that can fit you, back along the path of your movement.



### Elemental Form
Starting at 18th level, you may spend 10 sorcery points to transform into an air elemental or water elemental for up to 8 hours. This ability otherwise works as the *shapechange* spell.

<div class="card rest">

|:-|
| After a long rest: |
| * Regain use of ***One with the Ooze***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Your innate magic stems from a long family line of Ooze blood. For generations, the taint of Ooze blood has run in your family, infecting some at birth and sparing others, stemming from a well-documented but shadowy ancestor. It's unclear what horrific experiment infused a monstrous ooze or slime into his body so long ago, but some of his scattered descendants are born to this day with a personal, innate magic and bizarre physical characteristics.


### Indiscernible Anatomy
At 1st level, your placement and composition of your internal organs is bizarre. You take no additional damage from critical hits.

### Oozy Touch
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you can excrete slime with a touch. As an ***action***, you can make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage. You can expend 1 sorcery point make this touch rust metal, or rot wood, up to a maximum of 10 cubic feet of material. You have advantage on on Strength checks to break rusted metal or rotten wood.

This ability's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).



### Malleability
At 6th level, your body becomes more fluid. You can shift your features around and make yourself look differently while you maintain concentration on the change. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the physical change is up to you.

Additionally, you can expend 2 sorcery points to compress your body enough to squeeze through an inch-wide crack. You cannot expand inside a space that offers any resistance, such as an occupied suit of armor.

### Goopy Blood
By 14th level, your blood flows like a thick soup rather than a normal liquid. As a ***reaction*** expending up to 5 sorcery points when you are attacked, you can reduce the damage dealt by 3 times the number of sorcery points expended, up to a maximum of the damage dealt.

### One with the Ooze
At 18th level, your transformation into an ooze is complete. You can *polymorph*, as per the spell, into any ooze without expending a spell slot.

After you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-pandemonic">Pandemonic Sorcery</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Pandemonic Sorcery Features
| Sorcerer Level | Features |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st | Afflicted Affinity, Gale of Madness
| 6th | Twisted Perspective
| 14th | Shadow of Doubt
| 18th | Crushing Hopelessness

</div>

Your innate powers come from the insane, chaotic energies of Pandemonium, its magic giving you dominion over mind and madness. You may trace your lineage back to one of the few people who escaped its clutches, possibly someone who went mad from the constant, screaming winds. Perhaps you yourself endured the winds for a brief time, blowing in from a planar portal or somewhere planar boundaries are thin. Whatever the reason, the magic of Pandemonium is yours to command - though its energies can still affect your mind, making you question your reality and sanity.

At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Pandemonic Influence table to create an effect for your character.

#### Pandemonic Influence
| d6 | Influence |
|:-:|:-------|
| 1 | You have the same dream every night; walking alone in a stone tunnel, buffeted by never-ending winds. At the moment you lose hope of seeing the end, you wake.
| 2 | Darkness feels like a physical object to you, a dense, suffocating shroud only held back by light.
| 3 | You sometimes hear highly unsettling sounds blended with others, such as your name being called in the rush of water or tortured screams in the crackle of a fire.
| 4 | While you're alone, you hallucinate signs of imminent danger - shadows in the corner of your vision, the growl of something unnatural, and the like.
| 5 | You can always hear the distant sound of Pandemonium's winds, no matter where you are.
| 6 | In enclosed spaces, you sometimes hear cries for help close by. If you ignore them, they become more and more disturbing.



### Afflicted Affinity
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your connection to Pandemonium can allow you to identify the insane and the influenced. You can use an ***action*** to examine a creature you can see and determine if it is charmed, possessed, or under any other effect that would alter its personality or actions, and whether the effect is planar in nature. You don't identify the exact type of effect - for example, if a creature was under the effect of a geas spell, you would only know the creature was charmed.



<div class="infoarea" markdown="1">

#### Pandemonium: Inescapable Insanity
No other plane in existence - not the Nine Hells, nor the Abyss or Hades - embodies madness and futility more than the Windswept Depths of Pandemonium. Roaring winds scream through endless dark tunnels like the wail of tormented souls, grinding even the most stalwart down into insane, listless wrecks. Those resilient or resourceful enough to survive find no solace in this victory; one can wander the tunnels for weeks to find no other living soul, and portals are even rarer. For most travelers, the only escape is death.

</div>

### Gale of Madness
Also at 1st level, you can make a creature hear and feel Pandemonium's howling winds in its mind when you use your magic. Once on each of your turns when you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes deafened and frightened of you until the start of your next turn, panic stricken by the overwhelming assault on its senses.

After being targeted by this effect, a creature is immune to it until 24 hours have passed.

### Twisted Perspective
At 6th level, you can alter a creature's perception of reality before it strikes, turning your enemies against each other. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your ***reaction*** and spend 2 sorcery points to divert the attack. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the attacker must target a creature or object of your choice that is within range of the attack instead of the original target, other than itself. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until 24 hours have passed.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to the effect.

### Shadow of Doubt
At 14th level, you can become a blurred figment in the eyes of others only to reappear elsewhere, making them question if you're even present at all. You can use your ***bonus action*** and spend 1 sorcery point to teleport up to your speed to an unoccupied space you have a clear path to (for example, around a corner or up a steep cliff, but not through a keyhole), flickering between your current plane and Pandemonium for a few brief moments.

Additionally, your ability to identify the maladies of afflicted creatures improves. When you use your Afflicted Affinity feature, you can determine the exact types of effects a creature is influenced by, if any are present.

#### Crushing Hopelessness
At 18th level, you can wield Pandemonium's power to show other creatures the absolute futility of their efforts. You can use your ***action*** and spend 6 sorcery points to force a creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d12 psychic damage, gains a level of exhaustion, and is deafened and paralyzed for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), as Pandemonium's winds roar in their mind. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it takes 3d12 psychic damage and must make another Wisdom saving throw. The creature gains a level of exhaustion on a failure, and ends the effect on a success, losing all exhaustion caused by this feature.



A creature that gains 6 levels of exhaustion while under this effect, or is reduced to 0 hit points by it, doesn't die. Instead, the effect ends, the creature loses all exhaustion caused by this feature and it goes insane until cured by *greater restoration*, becoming stable if at 0 hit points. While insane, the creature's speed is reduced to 10 feet, it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws, it perceives all other creatures as enemies, it can't read, and it speaks only in gibberish.

Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix’s power dwells within you.

That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can’t bear to allow a fire to sputter out.  You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.

More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place. Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.

Phoenix sorcerers often have fire-related personality quirks.

#### Phoenix Sorcerer Quirks
| d6 | Quirk |
|:-:|:-------|
| 1 | You absentmindedly ignite small fires that quickly sputter out. |
| 2 | You cackle like a fiend when you unleash your fire spells. |
| 3 | You admire fire, even if it burns your friends. |
| 4 | You are covered in burns that mark the first time your power manifested. |
| 5 | You like your food charred. |
| 6 | You are brave to the point of recklessness. |




### Ignite
From 1st level, you gain the ability to start fires with a touch. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand—an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.

### Mantle of Flame
Starting at 1st level, you can unleash the phoenix fire that blazes within you. As a ***bonus action***, you magically wreathe yourself in swirling fire, with eyes glowing like hot coals. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
- You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
- Any creature takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet or if it touches you.
- Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus to equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Phoenix Spark
Starting at 6th level, the fiery energy within you grows restless and vengeful. In the face of defeat, it surges outward to preserve you in a fiery roar. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your ***reaction*** to draw on the spark of the phoenix. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

If you use this feature while under the effects of your Mantle of Flame, this feature instead deals fire damage equal to your sorcerer level + double your Charisma modifier, and your Mantle of Flame immediately ends.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Nourishing Fire
Starting at 14th level, your fire spells soothe and restore you. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that deals fire damage, you regain hit points equal to the slot’s level + your Charisma modifier.

### Form of the Phoenix
At 18th level, you finally master the spark of fire that dances within you. While under the effect of your Mantle of Flame feature, you gain additional benefits:
- You have a flying speed of 40 feet and can hover.
- You have resistance to all damage.
- If you use your Phoenix Spark, that feature deals an extra 20 fire damage to each creature

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Sometimes the magic that empowers a sorcerer comes from a source that would normally harm both nature and civilizations, though not necessarily be evil in and of itself. Plagues are one such thing as this, and you are a sorcerer who draws their power from the diseases and illnesses that fly on the winds of plagues. Perhaps you were changed by the effects of a plague, or were one of the only survivors of a deady disease that devastated your homeland. However you came to these powers, you are a harbinger of the plague.

#### Plaguebringer Quirks
| d6 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | You often cover yourself in bandages to hide scars from past diseases and afflictions.
| 2 | You enjoy the company of those who are sickly or diseased.
| 3 | The skin around your eyes, fingertips, lips, toes, and ears appears shriveled, blackened, and dry.
| 4 | Your eyes are a sickly color of green, red, black, or yellow.
| 5 | Your footprints on grass, plants, and other living natural terrain cause the plant life to wither and turn black.
| 6 | You have a raspy voice, as though you are always sick.

### Knowledge of the Infected
Starting at 1st level, your connection to plagues grants you unnatural powers. You gain immunity to disease, and learn the *poison spray* cantrip.

Additionally, your knowledge of diseases allows for you to more easily identify what causes sicknesses and how to diagnose them, as well as to treat them. You gain proficiency with such checks.

### Life of the Sickened
From 1st level, your body has become unaffected by rotting foods and some poisons. You are able to eat raw and rotten food without suffering ill effects from them. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition.

### Fear of the Contagious
By 6th level, your connection to the diseased and decaying has strengthened. You have resistance to necrotic damage.



In addition, you can cause those near you to become frightened of you by your appearance or illnesses. As an ***action***, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier, within 20 feet, to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, you cause a target to witness an illusion that makes their body appear to start decaying as if severely ill, and they become frightened of you until the end of their next turn.

Constructs, undead and creatures immune to being frightened are unaffected by this effect, and youregain use of this feature after a long rest.

### Aura of the Afflicted
By 14th level, you can use a ***bonus action*** to cast *stinking cloud* without expending a spell slot or using material components. When you cast stinking cloud in this way, the spell affects only an area with a 5 foot radius from you.

Additionally, whenever you come across someone who carries a disease, you can attempt to remove the disease from them and bear the disease yourself. By spending 1 minute in concentration while touching the afflicted individual, you can remove one disease from them. You then take on the appearance as having this disease for 1d6 days, though you suffer no ill effects of the disease itself.

### Form of the Rotten
At 18th level, you have become a harbinger of plagues. Any spell that you cast that causes disease or poison treats the diseases as magical.

In addition, you can spend 5 sorcery points to change the range of the spell *contagion* from touch to a 30 foot sphere centered on yourself. This spell moves with you and lasts up to 1 minute. Additionally, you can choose up to two diseases instead of one. When you choose two diseases, they both work at the same time, and each targeted creature must roll twice, once for each disease. You can choose a number of creatures within range of this spell up to your Charisma modifier to be immune to its effects.

<div class="card rest">
<div class="card-title restHeading">Rest Additions</div>
<div class="card-subtitle restPad">
The following additions are made to the general rest rules.
<div class="card-text restTable" markdown="1">

| Long rest |
|:-|
| After a long rest: |
| * Reset a ***Relic weapon of the Many***.
| &nbsp;
| Add the following bloodline specific benefits to choose from: |
| * Regain all charges from a ***Glyph stone***.
| * Regain all charges from an ***Umbral cloak***.

</div>
</div>
</div>


</div>

The wellspring of your arcane might lies not with an eldritch bloodline or the interference of wild magic, but with a deep cache of arcane power, stored within an ancient magic item. By fate, or perhaps by the item's wishes, your soul has become entwined with this magic item, which remains always at your side, empowering your abilities and motivating your quest.


### Relic Bond
Starting at 1st level, your very soul is bonded to a unique magic item, called a relic, from which you manifest your arcane might. If your relic is ever lost or destroyed, it manifests at your side when you next take a long rest. Choose one of the following options:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Glyph Stone
    Perpetually floating in an orbit about your person, this smooth stone is marked with a single ancient glyph along its side. You can use your glyph stone as an arcane focus, even though you do not need to hold it.

    The stone knows two cantrips of your choice. You can cast these cantrips as if you knew them, and they count as sorcerer spells for you.


    Additionally, the stone contains one spell of your choice from any class’s spell list. It has 3 charges that can be used to cast that spell by expending a number of charges equal to the spell’s cost in sorcery points, as shown on the Creating Spell Slots table.

    The stone gains an additional spell at 3rd, 6th and 14th levels.

- #### Relic Weapon
    Though the iron of this weapon is rusted and its wood is stained with blood, an unseen power weights its swing. Your relic weapon is your choice of any melee weapon. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed.

    You can use your ***action*** to summon your relic weapon to your open hand. You are proficient with it while you wield it. While holding your relic weapon and no other weapons, and not wearing armor or shield, you gain a +3 bonus to your armor class.

    When you use the Attack action to make an attack with your relic weapon, you can make an additional attack using a ***bonus action***.

</div>
<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Umbral Cloak
    This hooded cloak confounds the eye, seeming indistinct and difficult to focus upon. While you wear your umbral cloak, you are proficient on all stealth checks, and you can Hide as a ***bonus action***.

    Your umbral cloak has 3 charges, which can be used with a ***bonus action*** to become invisible, as the spell *invisibility*. If you begin your turn invisible, you can maintain this effect by spending a sorcery point. Otherwise, the spell ends.

</div>

### Sorcerous Recharge
By 6th level, your connection to your relic has strengthened. Your relic increases to having 6 charges. Additionally, you can use your ***action*** and expend any number of sorcery points to regain the same number of your relic's expended charges.

If you have a relic weapon, you may add your Charisma modifier to its damage.

### Greater Relic
At 14th level, your relic takes on an aspect of greater power. Choose one of the following features, as appropriate to your relic:

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Glyph Stone
    **of Dawn.** Your glyph stone learns the following spells: *bless, faerie fire, lesser restoration, prayer of healing, zone of truth, daylight, fireball* and *divination*.

    **of Warding.** Your AC increases by 1. Additionally, your glyph stone learns the following spells: *mage armor, shield, blur, hold person, counterspell, dispel magic* and *death ward*.

- #### Umbral Cloak
    **of Flight.** While you wear your umbral cloak, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast the *fly* spell as a ***bonus action*** without using a spell slot (no concentration required).

    **of Spaces Beyond.** You can use your ***action*** to reverse your umbral cloak, disappearing with your belongings into a 30-foot cube extradimensional space accessible only to you. Attacks and spells can't target you inside the space, but you can see and hear outside the space from the point you entered. Objects brought within the space remain there and can be retrieved by you later. You can exit the space as an ***action***, reappearing within 5 feet of where you entered.

    **of Swiftness.** While you are wearing your umbral cloak, opportunity attacks made against you have disadvantage and you can take the Dash action as a ***bonus action***.

- #### Relic Weapon
    **of the Many.** You can use your action to transform your relic weapon into any other weapon of your choice (though this transformation does not include ammunition). You are proficient with any form the weapon becomes while you wield it.

    When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following monster types: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. The weapon counts as a +3 weapon creatures of the chosen type until you next finish a long rest.

    **of Retribution.** When you take damage from an adjacent creature, you can use your ***reaction*** to make an attack against that creature using your relic weapon.

    **of Wounding**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with your relic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d8 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and can then make a Constitution saving throw against your spell savd DC, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success.

    Alternatively, a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ends the effect of such wounds on a success.


</div>


### Artifact
At 18th level, your relic becomes an artifact. It gains two minor and one major beneficial property, either selected at random or chosen by the DM. When you gain this feature, you can also choose to gain an additional minor beneficial property as well as one minor detrimental property, selected at random.












<hr class="classdivider">
<h1><a class="internal-link" name="internal-starTouched">Star Touched</a></h1>
<div class="featuresTable">

#### Star Touched Features
| Sorcerer Level | Features |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st | Stardust, Guiding Lights
| 6th | Strength of the Flame
| 14th | Shifting Cosmos
| 18th | Shooting Stars

</div>

By either an ancient ritual, or a birthright passed down through generations, you are able to use magic that reflects the power of stars. This magic, both old and powerful, can shape worlds or destroy them, and lets you shine the light from above down onto those who would face you.

#### Star Touched Quirks
| d4 | Quirk
|:--:|:---|
| 1 | Your body never appears to be effected by long exposure to sunlight.
| 2 | The footsteps you leave seem to singe, as if slightly burned.
| 3 | Your eyes seem to shine or twinkle brightly, and your skin is always warm to the touch.
| 4 | You envy the power of the sun, as you wish that you could be so grossly incandescent.

### Stardust
When you choose this origin at 1st level, the power of starlight is ingrained into your magic. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can summon a mote of starlight that orbits around you in your space. A mote sheds bright light in a 10 ft radius.

You can have a maximum number of motes orbiting around you equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sorcerer level, rounded down. Motes last for a minute, or until they move further than 120 feet away from you.

You can use your ***bonus action*** to send out an orbiting mote, to a point within 60 feet. Motes not orbiting you can be recalled as a ***bonus action***.

You can use your ***action*** to make a ranged spell attack, flinging the mote at a creature within 60 feet. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d8 radiant damage, and the mote sticks to the creature. That creature can use its action to remove the mote, at which point it will return to orbiting you. You can make additional attacks with your motes when you reach higher levels: you can attack with two motes as part of the same action at 5th level, three motes at 11th level, and four motes at 17th level. You can direct the motes at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each mote.

The number of motes you create per casting increases to 2 at 6th level, 3 at 14th level, and 4 at 18th level.



### Guiding Lights
Also at 1st level, your attunement to the stars allows you to find your way. While you can see the night sky, you gain advantage checks to navigate, and you always know which way is north.

### Strength of the Flame
At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire and radiant damage.

In addition, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire or radiant damage, you can choose to have blinding flames or light suddenly shine from you. This light forces creatures within 10 feet that you can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targets are blinded until the beginning of their next turn.

### Shifting Cosmos
At 14th level, when you send out a mote that is orbiting you, you can spend 1 sorcery point to travel with the mote, appearing within 5 feet of the mote you sent out, which then returns to orbiting you.

### Shooting Stars
At 18th level, you can now wield the destructive power of the cosmos, allowing you to cause your motes to detonate in a brilliant flash of destructive energy. As an ***action*** on your turn, you can cause any number of your motes to rush to a creature within 120 feet of you, spending 1 sorcery point for each mote.

The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw  against your spell save DC, taking 2d10 radiant damage per mote and be blinded until the start of its next turn on a failed save, and half as much damage and not be blinded on a successful save.

</div>

Beneath the surface of the ground, there exist those who have command over stone and rock, moving within the very earth itself. These beings have incredible powers, and are often revered for their constructive abilities as they are equally feared for their potential for utter destruction.

Perhaps you were born underground or at the base of a mountain, or came in contact with an immense being that lurks in the darkness of the deep earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. However you came into your power, you are an entity of the raw power of earth and stone, and as such are one of incredible earthen strength.

| 1 | You are always covered in some form of dirt, mud, or grime.
| 2 | Your eyes, fur, skin, wings, horns, or teeth appear greyish, as if made of stone.
| 3 | You have incredibly patience, and can wait in one spot for a long period of time before what you are expecting to happen occurs.
| 4 | The study of rocks and precious stones is not taken seriously enough, in your opinion.
| 5 | To you, having a ceiling of any kind over your head is better than an open sky.
| 6 | Your voice is unusually deep and rough.

### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons. Additionally, you learn the *mold earth* cantrip, and also have advantage on checks that involve stones or gems, such as identifying their worth, uses, and where they can be found.

### Mountain’s Durability
From 1st level, your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.



Additionally, as a ***reaction*** to taking damage, you can reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier as your skin suddenly grow stony on the part of your body that was hit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier.

### One with the Ground
Also from 1st level, you know how to utilize the earth itself to locate people and objects. As an ***action***, you gain tremorsense in a 15 feet radius, increasing to 30 feet at 14th level. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and you hahe to spend your action each turn to keep it active.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Stoneflesh
By 6th level, you can transform your skin into stone or rock to protect your body. As a ***bonus action***, you can spend 3 sorcery points to turn your skin to stone. For 1 minute or until you become incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:
* While not wearing armor, your AC increases by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier, though your movement speed decreases by 10 feet.
* You gain resistance to nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage. You gain resistance to magical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage at 14th level, and against all damage except for psychic damage and thunder damage at 18th level.
* Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 plus Charisma modifier bludgeoning damage. This counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance.
* You have disadvantage on checks while swimming.

### Earth Glide
At 14th level, you have gained immunity to the petrified condition. You also gain a burrowing speed up to 20 feet, and can burrow through non-magically worked earth and stone. While doing so, you do not disturb the material you move through.

### Strength of Stone
By 18th level, you have become one with stone and the earth. You no longer can be moved against your will, and spells you cast that deal bludgeoning damage and your unarmed strikes while your Stoneflesh feature is active deal additional damage equal to half your sorcerer level.

You also have learned how to turn the power of the earth against your enemies. As an ***action***, you can spend 5 sorcery points to cast the spell *earthquake* without concentration, and the spell’s range increases to 1000 feet.

| * Regain use of ***Wind Soul***.

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.

Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship’s crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.


### Wind Speaker
The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can understand, but not speak, Primordial (to level 4), and to a lesser extent its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran (to level 3).

### Tempestuous Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can use a ***bonus action*** on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Heart of the Storm
At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, you can choose to have stormy magic erupt from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.



### Storm Guide
At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.

If it is raining, you can use an ***action*** to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a ***bonus action***.

If it is windy, you can use a ***bonus action*** each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn’t alter the speed of the wind.

### Storm’s Fury
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your ***reaction*** to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

### Wind Soul
At 18th level, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. As an ***action***, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

A time thief's legacy originally comes from a time traveler, a master of chronomancy or just some creature heavily affected by time magic. He learns instinctively to manipulate time, in particular steal time. Mostly he steals boring, unneeded time from his own future, saving tiny split-seconds he can use to make his life easier in the present. As his powers grow, the time thief can learn to manipulate bigger slices of time, giving more options to enhance his actions or even alter the timeline of enemies and allies alike. Most of the time thief's effects are subtle to outside observers, seeming to be more good fortune and preternatural speed than control over time.


### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this bloodline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and martial weapons.

### Mote of Time
A mote is a tiny split-second of time that you steal from your own future. The motes taken are inconsequential slivers of continuance that even you will not notice being missing from your activities. However, you can use these motes to affect your present time, allowing you to retry actions and slow down time around you so you can act more carefully and alertly in fast-moving situations.

You have a pool of motes equal to your Charisma modifier. As a ***bonus action***, you can expend 1 sorcery point to regain a used mote. You can regain all your motes after a long rest.

Once per round, you can expend a mote to do any one of the following things:

* Gain a 1d4 bonus to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. The roll must represent a single action that occurs entirely within a single round. You can decide to add this bonus immediately after seeing the result of the original die roll.
* Take an additional reaction, bonus action or item action.
* Act in the surprise round when you would not normally be able to do so.

You may gain additional options for use of a mote by taking temporal talents, though you are still restricted to spending motes only once each round.



From 6th level, you can add the bonus from spending a mote of time to damage rolls or AC, until the beginning of your next turn.

From 14th level, you may spend a mote to reduce the duration of any negative condition or effect you are suffering. By accelerating the speed with which only the negative influences on you travel through time, you can reduce the duration of any one condition, affliction, or spell effect by 1d6 rounds.

At 18th level, you may spend a mote to take an additional move action.

### Temporal Talents
As you gain experience, you learn a number of talents that aid you and confound your foes. Starting at 6th level, you gain two temporal talents. You gain two additional temporal talents at 14th and 18th level. You cannot select an individual talent more than once unless otherwise noted.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Back to the Future
    You can spend two motes to fling yourself briefly into the future to observe the results of proposed acts or decisions in your present. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:<br/>
    -- Weal, if the action will probably bring good results.<br/>
    -- Woe, for bad results.<br/>
    -- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results<br/>
    -- Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad.

    The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you use this two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret

- #### Deja Vu
    By spending one mote, you can draw information from your future or past, allowing you to instantly gain the benefits of considerable study and reflection. You can even peer briefly into the future to see how others react to your various attempts at negotiation or subterfuge. This allows you to make a single Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma ability check with advantage.

- #### Evasion
    You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can spend a mote to instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

- #### Old Wounds
    As an ***action***, you can channel time into a wound, causing it to experience rapid healing, as if many days had passed. You may spend a mote to heal your own wounds, or the wounds of an ally touched. The wounds heal for 1d8 damage + your Charisma modifier.

- #### Steady Hand
    You can rewind time by small amounts to erase any minor mistakes you make as a result of distraction around you. By spending a mote, you may use skills reliably even under adverse conditions. Once you spend the mote, you have advantage on any single Dexterity check.

- #### Steal Fate
    As an ***action***, you can attempt to steal a crucial moment from a target's future, reducing the chance the target will enjoy a happy and prosperous future. You spend a mote to force the target to make a Charisma save or suffer a -1d4 penalty to all ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls. The DC is your spellcasting DC, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.

- #### Steal Time
    With this talent, you can steal time from a target by spending a mote after damaging a target with a melee attack. The target must make a Charisma save, using your spellcasting DC, or have disadvantage to all ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls until the end of its next turn.

- #### Time After Time
    You gain advanced ability to manipulate time and may now spend motes on two effects per round.

- #### Time Bandit
    Your access to motes increases and you gain an additional number of motes per day equal to your Charisma modifier. This talent may be taken more than once, adding the same number of additional motes each time it is selected.

- #### Time to Kill
    As a ***bonus action***, you can spend two motes to set up a perfect weapon blow. The next melee attack you make before the end of your turn has advantage and and deals a number of d6 additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

- #### Time Runner
    You can move briefly through time, taking an ***action*** that does not exist in the normal sequence of reality. By spending two motes, you gain an additional move action. You do not set off traps, do not provoke attacks of opportunity, nor do other creatures notice you during this move action. After the move action time catches up to you, triggered traps go off and other creatures notice you where you now stands.

- #### Uncanny Dodge
    When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can spend a mote to use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

</div>

### Aevum
At 14th level, you gain the ability to control aevum - distinct moments of important time, stolen from the future and used to power your abilities. Unlike a mote, which is a very minor split second of time, an aevum is a more noteworthy moment, a crucial instance when something important happened. While you have a ready supply of motes to spend on minor effects, aevum represent more major manipulations of time and are thereby a rarer commodity.

When first gained, you must select a single power from the list below and you have a single aevum to spend. You gain an additional aevum power and an additional aevum to spend at 18th level. Spending an aevum is an ***action*** unless the ability description says otherwise. You regain all your aevum after a long rest.

<div class="columnstwo">

- #### Bolt Time
    By spending an aevum, you can accelerate your movements to a speed that allows you to easily see and react to the movement of a crossbow bolt or other projectile as it flies toward a target. You remain in bolt time for as long as you keep your concentration, up to 1 minute. While in bolt time, you gain the following benefits:

    -- You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br/>
    -- You may add your Charisma modifier to melee attacks, melee damage, AC and Dexterity saves.<br/>
    -- All of your modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice your normal speed using that form of movement.<br/>
    -- Each round, you may automatically dodge the first ranged attack you are aware of that would otherwise strike you.

- #### Entropy
    You can force a target to suddenly feel the effects of aging, which damages and weakens it. As an ***action***, you can spend an aevum to make a spell attack against any target you can see within 100 ft. If you hit the target, it takes 12d8 necrotic damage.

- #### Personal Time
    You can take risky actions and, if things go badly, simply reverse your personal timeline to before you made the effort. At the beginning of your turn, spend an aevum and take one normal round of actions, with all results noted temporarily. After your round of activity, before the next creature's turn begins, you must decide if you are going to keep the round of activity you just took, or rewind herself.

    If you keep the round of activity, any changes made to any character during her turn become permanent. If you decide to reverse the timeline, you go back to the moment you spent the aevum, and all changes that occurred during your round are erased from all creatures and items. No one but you remembers actions that took place during a round of time you reverse, and only divination spells of 8th level or higher can reveal such events. If you are killed or knocked unconscious during a round of personal time, you automatically revert back to the beginning of your turn.

- #### Time Cross
    You can focus your timeline-stealing powers on a target, and steal from it a moment of success. Spend an aevum as a ***reaction*** to force a target to reroll a single attack roll, damage roll, ability check, or saving throw you are aware of. The reroll is made with disadvantage.

- #### Time Stop
    You can spend an aevum to cast the *time stop* spell on yourself. You must be at least 18th level to select this aevum ability.

</div>


### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

</div>

Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

### Wild Magic Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect.

### Tides of Chaos
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to reroll a dice roll.

Any time you roll a Wild Magic Surge, you regain the use of this feature.



### Bend Luck
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your ***reaction*** and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d10 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

### Controlled Chaos
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

### Spell Bombardment
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

</div>

Imbued with magic from a powerful, reality-altering wish, your destiny is to bring hope to others and grant their desires, while simultaneously realizing your own. Perhaps an ancestor impressed a being of great power with their selflessness, or maybe instead a selfish wish for power has been twisted into a lesson in humility. In either case, the power of wishes flows in your veins, empowering both you and your allies.

### Bestow Power
At 1st level, you gain an uncanny sense of the wants and desires of others, and the ability to aid in obtaining them. You gain proficiency with Insight, and learn the *guidance* cantrip.

When you cast *guidance* on another creature, you can choose to extend the effect to all rolls for one particular skill during the full duration. When casting *guidance* this way, you may instead of a skill grant the bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, one type of saves or AC.

You may only use this feature once, and gain additional uses at 6th and 14th levels.

### Wishbound Arcana (Your Wish Is My Command)
Also at 1st level, you gain a limited ability to grant the wishes of others in a manner you see fit.

Whenever you hear a creature other than yourself express a desire or wish, you can use your ***action*** before the end of your next turn to fulfill it. When you do, you cast a spell you know that could be construed as fulfilling that desire. For example, you could cast *invisibility* on a creature who wished to disappear, or *blindness* if someone wished they didn't have to look at you. You must be able to understand the wish, but can deliberately misinterpret it.

You can't be targeted by such a spell. Casting a spell this way does not expend a spell slot. You can fulfill a wish this way once per long rest.



### Well of the Heart
At 6th level, you find that helping others invigorates you and fills you with purpose. Whenever you target an ally and cast a beneficial spell that does not restore hit points, you immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier plus the level of the spell.

### Holder of Fate
Starting at 14th level, you can split your focus and maintain concentration on two spells at once. Both spells must be sorcerer spells, and none may target multiple creatures.

When you do so, you expend sorcery points equal to the level of the higher spell. You must then use your ***bonus action*** on each of your turns to maintain concentration, or the second spell ends. You make only one concentration check with disadvantage whenever you take damage, and failing the check ends both spells.

Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until after a long rest.

### Heart’s Desire
By 18th level, your dedication to aiding others has allowed you to more easily imbue yourself with power. When you cast a beneficial spell on a friendly target, you may also cast the same effect on yourself. If the spell normally targets more than one creature, you do not count towards the spell's normal targets.










<h2><a class="internal-link" name="internal-metaMagic">Metamagic</a></h2>


At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

<div class="columnsthree">

- ### Burning Spell
    When you cast a spell that deals acid, fire or poison damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip) to make the spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage on the start of your the next round. If the spell targets only one creature, the damage dealt is equal to half the original (roll half the number of dice and apply half of the bonuses, round down). If the spell targets several creatures or is an area spell, the extra damage is equal to twice the sorcery points spent.

- ### Careful Spell
    When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

- ### Chaotic Spell
    When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may spend up to 1 sorcery point to make the spell immediately roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.

- ### Concussive Spell
    When you cast a spell that deals thunder damage, you can spend 2 sorcery point to add a concussive sonic wave that rattles creatures affected by the spell. If the target/s fail a Constitution saving throw, they are incapacitated until the end of your next round.

- ### Distant Spell
    When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

    When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

- ### Empowered Spell
    When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

    You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

- ### Extended Spell
    When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

- ### Flaring Spell
    When you cast a spell that deals fire, radiant of electricity damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add a flaring effect. If the target/s fail a Constitution saving throw, they are blinded until the end of your next round.

- ### Frightful Spell
    When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 sorcery points. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

- ### Heightened Spell
    When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

- ### Lingering Spell
    When you lose concentration on a spell, voluntarily or not, you may spend 1 sorcery point to force the spell to linger for one additional round. You may continue to do this for several rounds, but the cost increases with 1 point each round. This does not let you keep two concentration spells simultaneously.

- ### Precise Spell
    When you cast a spell that requires one or more spell attack rolls, you can expend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on one roll.

- ### Quickened Spell
    When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

- ### Restorative Spell
    When you cast a spell, you may spend 1 sorcery point to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the spell's level (a cantrip gives 1 temporary hit point).

    You may use this metamagic option even if you have used another on the same spell.

- ### Rime Spell
    When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to let frost from your spell cling to the target, impeding it for a short time. If the target/s fail a Constitution saving throw, they are restrained until the end of your next round.

- ### Sculpt Spell
  When you cast a spell with a range that affects an area, you can expend 1 sorcery point to change the area's shape in one of the following ways:<br/>
    -- If the spell's range is a line, you can change it to a cone of half range.<br/>
    -- If the spell's range is a cone, you can change it to a 5 foot wide line with double range.<br/>
    -- If the spell's range is a sphere, you can change its area to a cylinder of half radius and double height.<br/>
    -- If the spell's range is a cylinder, you can change its area to a sphere of the same radius.

- ### Seeking Spell
    When you cast a spell that requires a spell attack roll, you can expend 1 sorcery point to target a creature that has left your line of sight since your last turn but is still within the range of the spell. Additionally, this spell ignores half cover and three-quarters cover.

- ### Stable Spell
    When a spell you cast would get countered by counterspell or dispelled by dispel magic, you may spend 2 sorcery points as a reaction to impose disadvantage on the check made by those spells. If your spell would be countered or dispelled without a roll, you instead force the roll to occur.

    You may use this metamagic option even if you have used another on the same spell, and can use this option multiple times per spell.

- ### Subtle Spell
    When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

- ### Twinned Spell
    When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery  points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

- ### Uncanny Concentration
    You have learned to enter a deeper state when casting spells, allowing you to shrug off distractions, damage, and even the effects of other spells. By spending 3 sorcery points you gain advantage on concentration checks, while concentrating on this spell.

- ### Unerring Spell
    If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the attack roll. You must use the result of the second roll. You can use Unerring Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

- ### Zombifying Spell
    When you kill at least one creature with a spell you may expend 3 sorcery points to cause one creature slain by the spell to rise as zombies under your control (as *animate dead*) for the next minute. You may expend additional sorcery points to animate additional slain creatures.
