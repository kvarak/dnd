# Skills
Traits and skills that increase the efficacy and efficiency in combat. Whenever a skill refers to a save, the DC is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + the attribute you use for the weapon.

### When do I get combat skills?
You will get skill points to spend on combat skills mostly from you character choice.
- Each class receives a set number of skills at 1st level.
- When leveling up, classes get skill points to spend at different class levels. Some classes and archetypes may have class features that grant skills or skill points.
- In addition, during character creation, you might gain access to one or more skills.

### Spending skill points
Unless otherwise noted, each skill costs 1 skill point. To buy a skill you must know the skill right above it in the “skill tree”. You can save skill points, and are allowed to spend them at a later time, after finishing a long rest.

### Terms
- **Expertise**. You have advantage on checks using this proficiency.
- **Melee**. Melee weapons are used to attack targets within 5 ft.
- **Trait**. A trait is a binary skill; either you can do it or not. A roll is not required in most cases.

The following traits are included in all weapon groups.
- Rank 1 - ***Simple Weapon Proficiency***. Includes all Simple weapons in group

- Rank 3 - ***Weapon Master***. You may reroll an attack with a weapon in this group. Use resets after a long rest.
- Rank 4 - ***Weapon Master II***. The use of weapon master is reset every time you crit.
