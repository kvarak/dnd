-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-AbilityChecks">Ability Checks</a>
    The three main rolls of the game — the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll — rely on your ability scores. Roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

    If you are proficient with the saving throw, a weapon you are attacking with or in an appropriate skill while making an ability check, you additionally add your proficiency bonus.

-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-AbilityScores">Ability Scores</a>

    Generate ability scores by rolling 4d6, and choosing three of them. After each roll, assign the score to one of your abilities. When you have rolled and assigned the first four ability scores you can choose to either continue rolling the last two as well, or assign an 8 and a 15 to the last ability scores.

-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-Fatepoints">Fate points</a>

    When you create your character, you will receive a Fate power which is powered by Fate points. If you start at level 1, you gain 2 Fate points, otherwise you start with 1. Whenever you gain an increase in your proficiency modifier, you also gain a Fate point.

-   ### Herbalism

    <a href="1.1-herbalism.html">Herbalism can be found here.</a>

-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-Hitpoints">Hit points</a>

    You start first level with a hit point maximum equal to the highest roll of your hit die, modified by your Constitution modifier.

    When you roll for hit points at higher levels, if you roll a 1 you may reroll the die and must use the new roll.

-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-Inspiration">Inspiration</a>

    You can hold up to 3 inspiration points at once. When making an ability check, you can spend a die *after* you see result to reroll. For other rolls, you have to spend the dice before the roll in order to gain advantage on the roll.

-   ### Languages

    <a href="1.3-languages.html">Languages can be found here.</a>

-   ### <a class="internal-link" name="internal-Luck">Luck</a>

    In addition to the six basic abilities, you also have a seventh, Luck. Your Luck is generated by rolling 3d6.
