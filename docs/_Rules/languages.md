# Expanded Rules for Languages
G*oswin let his hammer fall to the sand and sat down next to Zandru, who was listlessly plucking at his lute strings. “Something’s wrong,” the dwarf said. “Talk to me.”*

*Zandru sighed. “Well, it’s two weeks we’ll be spending in Garhaim. Two weeks of banquets, parties and a coronation the likes of which I’ve never seen and may never see again. But it’s two weeks deep in Dwarven land, and I’m the only one here who doesn’t speak Dwarvish! Think of all the jokes I’ll miss, all the conversations I won’t get to be a part of. Even if I just knew a Dwarvish song or two to impress the guests.”*

*Goswin chuckled. “Well, if you really want to learn, and if you promise to listen, I’ll see what I can make stick in that brain of yours. Now pay attention.”*

### Picking it up as you go
D&D approaches languages in an "all or nothing" way -- you either know a language completey, or you don't know it at all, and the options that give additional language after character creation are few and far between. The following is a set of optional language rules for your adventures. These rules allow for learning a language in stages, so your characters can pick up just enough language to get around a new place without relying on magic or taking vast amounts of downtime.

Languages are divided into five general levels of complexity, which can be attained through study and training. Each level takes more time and is harder to attain than the next.


### Character Creation
At the end of character generation you will determine the proficiency level for each language you know as follows: One language you choose will be your primary language (level 5). You get a number of points equal to 3 times the number of languages you received in your background, modifies by your Intelligence modifier. You may spend these points on your known languages as you wish.

For this purpose, reading/writing counts as a language.

### Study
The days to next level column refers to the minimum number of days of training before the next language level can be accessed. These days, which consist of both study and practice, may be done during downtime, or as camp activity while traveling (INT check against camp DC).

Your teacher can be anyone who agrees to teach you. They don’t need to be fluent in the language, but they cannot bring you to a level higher than their own. A teacher also needs to use their camp activity or a minor downtime activity while teaching.




Once the minimum number of days for a student's current level has been met, the student may attempt an Intelligence check against the next level’s Aquisition DC.

In order to attempt the Acquisition check once more, a student must undergo additional days of training equal to half of the number of training hours they had just completed, rounded down. This reduction is cumulative with successive failed checks.

##### Example
Zandru does not know Dwarvish. He spends 4 days of study, at the end of which he attempts an Intelligence Check, DC 5 to attain Basic Dwarvish (Level 1). He fails the roll and must spend 2 more days before attempting the check again.

If he fails a second time, he must spend 1 more day of study before attempting the check again. Once Zandru finally passes his check, he has attained Basic Dwarvish (Level 1).

He can use the language at that level, and he can begin training in Beginner Dwarvish (Level 2).

### Using Language
Language use at or below your level will work normally. attempting to convey a meaning to or by someone above their level requires a Wisdom (insight) check by the listener, with a DC equal to 15 (+10 for each level above the lowest). If the check is failed you will still understand or communicate an amount appropriate to your level.

### Reading and Writing
Most people never learn how to read/write, and this includes your character, unless having attended some formal education. Even so, your maximum potential reading level is 3, modified by your Intelligence modifier. Hower, it can never be higher than the speaking level of the language you are reading.

<div class="descriptive" markdown="1">

##### Example
Augustu Vira knows Varisian at level 5, Common at level 3 and Elvish at level 1.

He additionally knows how to read/write, but with his intelligence modifier of -1, his potential maximum reading level is 2, so this is what he has purchased at the start.

The result is; when reading Varisian or Common, his reading level is 2. However, when trying to read Elvish, his language skills sets the max limit, which is 1.

## Additional Rules

<div class="columnsthree">

- Any feats that grant a language do so at a Conversant level.

- **Linguist**. Instead of gaining 3 languages, you gain 9 additional points to improve your languages or add new ones. Additionally, you gain the following ability; You can gain temporary language proficiency through study. By spending 3 days studying or immersed in a language you gain Basic profiencies. With 1 week study you can gain Beginner proficiency. You must speak or study the language for a full day at least once per week or this proficiency is lost.

- ##### What'd You Say About my Mother?!
    A roll of 1 will result in a mistranslation of a key peice of language.
