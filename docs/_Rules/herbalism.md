# Herbalism
If you have proficiency with the herbalism kit, you know where to find useful plants, identify them, safely collect them, and know how to use them properly.

### The herbalism kit
An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars.

### Gathering herbs
You can gather herbs during travel, or during downtime.

 **Travel**. As an alternative travel activity, you can forage for useful plants. If you do, you don’t contribute to the groups Perception for noticing hidden threats.

 **Downtime**. During periods in between sessions, you can search for herbs in the surrounding area. While doing this, you are assumed to be able to sell some of the useful plants you find, and can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day.

The DC to find useful plants is 15, or 20 in deserts, arctic, and other inhospitable areas. If you succeed, roll a 1d4 to determine how many ingredients were gathered. Then find the most relevant terrain type in the terrain tables and determine what herbs you found.

### Using herbs
In each herb description, it states the final effect, the time it takes, and any additional costs. You are assumed to have enough knowledge to prepare the herbs (otherwise you probably wouldn’t have picked them), but in some cases there might be additional checks to create the final product.

Unless otherwise noted, a herb can be prepared during a long rest.

## Terrain
This tables are used to randomly determine which ingredient are found in different terrains. Additional rulings can be found next to each ingredient on the charts below.

## Herb descriptions

<div class="columnsthree">

- **Aloe Vera**. Used in salves. When applied within 1 minute, it heals half of the fire damage dealt to a creature. Application takes 1 round per 10 hp healed (which might cause it to be too late to heal).

- **Blightshroom**. This fungus can be use to make a sickly green concoction, called blight ichor, that harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature ingesting a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability to psychic damage, for 1 hour.

  For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1d6 hours and suffer the effects of a confusion spell for 1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the frightened condition for 1 hour.

- **Blue Toadshade**. This dark blue cap with a yellow striped stem is a common mushroom in the Underdark. When disturbed, it lets off a puff of blue powder. Usually this causes no harm to the surrounding creatures, but it can stain their skin and equipment for a short while. The powder is commonly used to color various inks and dyes. If the mushroom is carefully picked, it can be used for its healing properties. It burns really slowly, filling a small room with faint smoke that persists for an hour. Any creatures resting in the area regains 1 additional hit point per level. Multiple uses in a 24-hour period do not stack.

- **Bramble Hold**. This red-purple tea is brewed from a mixture of berries native to most temperate forests. It has a strong, sweet taste and is often used as a late evening drink. Though not inherently intoxicating, bramble hold has strong magical connotations and is highly sensitive to the magic of druids and the fey. If an enchantment spell of third level or lower is cast upon bramble hold while brewing, it will absorb the magical qualities. The brew can hold the magic for up to 24 hours. Any creature drinking the brew is affected as though they had been targeted by the enchantment. They receive all normal saving throws.

- **Bride's Veil**. A thin, ghostly white mushroom with a thin, veil-like skirt billowing from under its cap. Bride's Veils become almost completely transparent in moonlight, and grow at the edges of thick forests. The skirts, though extremely fragile, can be woven together into fabric using a precise hand (though very few have been known to possess the talent) for qualities similar to a cloak of invisibility. When brewed into a tea or liquid, the consumer experiences the effects of *invisibility* for 1d4 minutes.

- **Ceran**. A short, hardy shrub that grows in cold climates. Drinking herbal brew made from the leaves of this plant will result in a warm tingling feeling inside, all the effects of being in extreme cold conditions will be negated for 2d4 hours.

- **Colewort**. Colewort is a small plant with a single large glossy leaf, and small white flowers with four petals. It grows near arctic and temperate rivers. Anyone who chews on the flowers before drinking will remain be immune to the effects of alcohol for at least 2 hours. Its effects protect only against alcohol, and not against any other drug or toxin.

- **Dahkra** A reedy hollow grass that smells like sweet hay and corn, found growing near rivers in mild climates. Dahkra must be added to water and boiled over a flame for a few minutes. Can be fed to beasts, it will put them to sleep for 3d4 hours.

- **Darkberry**. Short bushes with spindly branches and fluffy green leaves, the plant is known for the unusual berries that only a few of the bushes produce. The small purple berries contain essence from the Plane of Shadow, and the bushes are said to only grow where the Shadow Weave is strongest. When a darkberry is split or crushed, it releases shadowstuff, creating a circle of darkness with a 5ft-radius. This darkness lasts for 1d6 rounds.

- **Desna's Gift**. The white capped mushroom is a magical mushroom created by The Lady Luck herself. They are seen as a sign that Desna has blessed the location you found them in, or is aiding you on your journey. Many have reported finding them in their time of need, or seeing them just appear when they were in danger, or about to embark on a perilous journey.

  You can eat these raw, which restores 2 hit dice, or you may cook and eat them, restoring 5 hit dice, or 10 if you succeed at a DC 15 cooking check. The recovery can be divided among any number of characters. After being picked, these mushrooms need to be used within a day, otherwise they loose their potency.

- **Devilweed**. Tobacco-like smoked drug. It takes a few days to dry them, but no other preparation is needed. Smoking it grants advantage on Strength and Constitution checks, but disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma checks for the next 1d6 hours.

- **Draaf**. The leaves of the hardy Draaf bush can be eaten in order to restore 1d4 hit points, as long as they are eaten within 10 minutes of the damage being inflicted.

- **Entriste**. A small-leafed ivy that hugs the ground. Entriste's leaves absorb liquid and, when crushed, may be used to draw poison from a wound. A leaf absorbs a quarter-pint of liquid. It causes 1d4 damage but draws 100% of poison from a wound if applied within 5 rounds of poisoning from a contact or injury poison, -25% for each round thereafter. This does not heal any instant effects of the poison, but can remove lingering effects.

- **Exspiravit**. A pale white mushroom that sheds a phantom silver glimmer in darkness. Said to grow where a man with unfinished business died, it’s often found in graveyards and ancient tombs. If properly dried for 24 hours the consumer will be able to cast *speak with the dead* once.

  With a failed Constitution save (DC 10) they will have hallucinations of dead people talking to them. It is said that these hallucinations represent the spirits of the corpses buried under the mushroom even though this is clearly nonsense born from popular superstitions. There are rumors of people who found ancient treasures long forgotten by following the instructions of these “spirits”.

- **Faerie Wings**. These thin, blue flowers rest atop slender, fragile stalks. Faerie wings grow in bare hilltops or amongst mushroom rings in forests. Drinking a brew prepared from these flowers grants the ability to see invisible objects up to five feet away for one minute.

- **Faranir tree**. This strange looking, crescent-shaped nut grows from 30-ft leafy trees in tropical climates from long, thin filaments of near-invisible silk. While the silk is sought after for use as fine embroidery thread, the nut can be boiled and reduced to a sticky, white paste. When applied to any item, this paste protected the item from acid, corrosion, and rust for 3d4 days.

- **Featherfew**. This herb grows to about 18 inches in height with many small white flowers. The flowers must be dried and then boiled in white wine. When the resulting mixture is drunk it will remove the effects of vertigo from a person for up to twelve hours. It does this by stabilizing the persons inner ear. As a side-effect of stabilizing the inner ear, the herb also calms the fear centers of the brain, allowing for the recipient to overcome extreme fear for 2d6 hours (advantage on saving throws against fear).

- **Flayleaf**. These narrow, rust-colored leaves produce a mildly hallucinogenic smoke that also serves as powerful sedative. The process of preparing them is easy, basically crushing the dried leaves, but it takes a couple of weeks, as they need to dry. Users are immune to pain for 4 hours after smoking flayleaf, but during this time they have disadvantage on saves against mind-altering effects.

- **Ginseng**. Must be dried and steeped as tea. When drunk, it grants advantage on Constitution saving throws for 10 minutes.

- **Goblin Rogue**. Medium-sized bush with yellow-orange berries found in temperate regions during autumn. It can be made into Goblin ink, which is waterproof. The process takes 2 days, and requires common ingredients worth 1 gp.

- **Goldbark Bud**. The foul-tasting bulb from this yellow tulip-like flower can be chewed to gain a degree of mental clarity, and is sometimes used by student scholars and apprentice wizards. For one minute, those who chew the bulb gain advantage on all Intelligence based checks. Unfortunately, there is a side effect: for one hour afterwards, the recipient suffers disadvantage on those same checks.

- **Guardseye**. This 40 cm high perennial has smooth, dark blue leaves and a woody stem. It has white, cuplike flowers, with purple flecks on the inside. In autumn, the plant dies except for a thick root than can be up to 50 cm long, but even dead, it does not shed its leaves. When cooked in water, the resulting tea will grant the drinker the ability to see invisible, phased, ethereal and similarly affected creatures. The effect last for 1d6 hours.

- **Gylvir**. This is an algae. When eaten it allows a person to breathe underwater (and only underwater!) for a period of four hours.

- **Halcyon Crocus**. In highland meadows and cold tundra grows a pale white-silver crocus. By starlight, nectar can be harvested from its simple bloom and dried into snuff that engulfs the user in bittersweet recollections of yore. With each dose of the Halcyon Snuff the user remembers a spell forgotten, effectively regaining a 1st level spell slot. If several doses are taken simultaneously, higher level spell slots can be regained, up to the number of doses taken. However, other memories linger uninvited to forever haunt and burden the user of this drug. Each dose inflicts 2d8 psychic damage after the initial effect. The creation of the snuff is complicated. The process takes 2 weeks, and requires common ingredients worth 50 gp.

- **Halfling Thistle**. Small hardy thistle with a violet flower that grows in all temperature areas, especially highlands. It can be made into Shinewater, which removes all rust and corrosion from metal objects left to soak in it overnight. One dose de-rusts a medium-sized metal weapon. Creating Shinewater takes 2 days, and requires common ingredients worth 2 gp.

- **Harrada tree**. The resin of the Harrada tree is has healing properties if allowed to dry on the tree. When burned, it fills a small room with faint smoke that persists for an hour. Any creatures resting for at least en hour in the area regains 1 additional hit point per level. Multiple uses in a 24-hour period do not stack.

- **Hightop Bloom** This bright orange yellow flower has a similar effect to cannabis when it’s oils are heated to a very specific temperature. When smoked, it dulls the pain receptors in your body, granting 2d8 temporary hit points for 1 hour. It also is a mild hallucinogenic, causing the affected to gain disadvantage on saving throws against mind affecting effects for the duration.

- **Hyancinth Nectar**. This blue and white thick liquid can be extracted from the hyancinth, which grows near somewhat wet areas. It is used to make antitoxin, which grants advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. The process takes 2 days, and requires common ingredients worth 1 gp.

- **Iraster**. This ground plant grows in neat, almost perfectly cubic shrubs about 2 ft. by 2 ft. wide. Most creatures know to avoid these plants, but they are sometimes used as a recreational drug by bored goblins. The small rainbow-striped, or dotted berries this shrub produces will cause a surge of natural magical energy to enter the recipient. Roll twice on the Wild Magic Surge table, and keep the result closest to 500.

- **Jinab**. The dark chocolate-brown bark of this small fast growing tree, may be eaten in order to allow a person to remain awake for one whole week, without the need for sleep. At the end of this period, they will collapse absolutely exhausted, instantly gaining 5 levels of exhaustion.

- **Jojopo**. The leaf of this pale blue-green, fuzzy herb is commonly applied to frostbite. If applied within 3 turns of taking frost damage, proper application of the herb will cure 2d6 points of cold damage. The poultice made from this plant is usable for at least 2 weeks after preparation.

- **Kaitlin’s Weed**. A short leafy stalk that grows fine red hairs along the prominent bud, it is often mistaken for the taller Dragon’s Breath. Those well versed in herbalism also know that the weed can be used to create a balm which soothes sunburn, and helps alleviate the pain from other burns (if applied within 2 turns of taking fire damage, capable of healing 2d4 fire damage). The process to create the balm takes 1 week, and requires common ingredients worth 2 gp.

- **Laumspur**. The flower of this moss is dried and steeped as tea. If the tea is drunk during a short rest, any expended Hit Dice restore the maximum number of hit points.

- **Lavender**. Must be dried and steeped as tea. It grants immunity to being magically put to sleep and advantage on any saving throws involved with magical effects that would affect their sleep for 24 hours.

- **Mallow**. A tall plant with many star shaped leaves sprouting from the main stalk, the mallow plant is notable for the large five petal white flowers. Several tribes use the flowers for decoration, especially during fertility ceremonies. Tea can be brewed from the plant, said to ward away any “evil spirits”. Those that drink the tea gain advantage on any saving throw meant to resist mind control or possession for 1 hour.

- **Mandrake Root**. This tan root has serrated edges all along its body that often cause injury to herbalists that do not properly know how to handle it. When stripped of its outer skin, the center can be chewed on, and is often used to reduce pain. The root can be ground to a paste and then boiled with some other ingredients to produce a foul-tasting, milky tonic that grants advantage on saving throws against disease for an hour. The process takes 2 days, and requires common ingredients worth 1 gp.

- **Masthin**. Plant that produces natural intoxicants when young. If its shoots are used as a component for any enchantment spell targeting animals or magical beasts, they have a 40% chance of doubling spell duration.

- **Mellowrot**. This root can easily be prepared into a paste in an hour. Sneaky goblin chieftains give this orange paste to the tribe's warriors before proposing a particularly bold raid. Consuming mellowroot causes a euphoric feeling that makes you feel invulnerable. For 1 hour after consuming mellowroot, you gain advantage on saves against fear effects. However, while under the effects of mellowroot, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when you try to leave the threatened area of an opponent. If you fail the saving throw, you cannot leave the threatened area with that action but do not lose the action.

- **Milkweed Seeds**. These small, white translucent seeds can be found when opening up a milkweed flower. They are often eaten by children due to their friendly look, but can cause negative digestive effects this way. When crushed up and mixed with other common herbs, these seeds offer very powerful healing effects. It can be compacted into a bandage and then laid across a wound, where it hardens and assists in the healing process. Once a healing poultice is applied, it heals 2d4+2 hp. Up to 3 uses can be applied at the same time (healing 4d4+4 hp for two, or 6d4+6 for three).

- **Musk Muddle**. Stinky, brown, dead-looking plant with wide leaves found in swamps and marshes, and is a sign of the Undead, often growing on the sites where undead were raised.

- **Nightshade Berries**. These light blue berries can be found in small clumped packs among small bushes in lush environments. They can be safely ingested and are often eaten by wild animals for their sweet, but tangy flavor. The tiny seeds in the berries can be ground up and added when making candles. This heavily scented candle smells pleasant to humans and humanoids but is repellent to insects. Non-monstrous vermin will not approach within a 5-foot radius of a burning candle. It burns for 1 hour. Making the candles require candlemakers tools an takes a couple of hours (long rest).

- **Oiolosse**. This exceedingly rare herb will restore an elf to life if given within seven days of death. This effect also works on half-elves up to 3 days.

- **Pesh**. The milk of this vibrantly green cactus, when mixed with resins and other ingredients, congeals into sticky, black chunks with an exceedingly sour taste. Unless refining it, which takes about two days, using materials costing 5 sp, it does not have much effect, with the exception of a mild vertigo. Though pesh comes in several different varieties, refined pesh is both the most potent and expensive type. Taking refined pesh gives a person 15 temporary hit points for 1 hour, a +2 bonus on saves versus fear effects for 1 day, and disadvantage to Dexterity and Wisdom checks for 1 day. Pesh is addictive (Constitution save DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Dexterity and Wisdom damage.

- **Pollencloud Berries**. These yellow, black striped berries, roughly the size of a bean, when toasted for 10 minutes over a fire, become reddish, frail, dry and susceptible to impacts; when thrown to the ground, these berries release their the same effect of a *fog cloud* spell, but with a duration of 1 minute and with a red tinge.

- **Purple Pipeweed**. A short, purple weed that was originally a farm-field pest before it was found it can be dried and smoked. It is in fact very commonly smoked by spellcasters that focus on illusory magic. For one hour after smoking a pipeweed, the consumer is elevated to a higher state of imagination. This unfortunately makes them inattentive, (enemies in combat will always have a surprise round against the pipeweed smoker while under its effects) but also increases the spell save DC of any illusion magic cast by the pipeweed user by +2.

- **Ripplebark**. Shelf-like fungus that looks like rotting flesh but is perfectly edible, although it tastes better if cooked properly. Restores 1d4+1 hit points if eaten raw and 2d4+2 hit points if properly prepared.

- **Sakrash**. The fruits of this tree can be made into a sweet oily wine called Twilight wine. This takes a few weeks and requires brewer’s supplies, and materials worth 2 gp. When drinking this wine, you cannot be detected by effects that read or alter thoughts or emotions for 1d4 hours. However, your eyes become sensitive to light, causing disadvantage on all saves against light effects.

- **Sparkleberry**. A single stalk bearing a number of curled leaves, the sweet berries of the plant sparkle radiantly in direct sunlight. Villagers often know of nearby patches of wild sparkle berries, and pick them in mid-summer. The berries have a variety of methods by which they are eaten. Fresh berries are often served with cheese, and many are processed into jams and jellies to be preserved for later. Consumption of the raw berries grants resistance to radiant damage for 10 minutes while consumption of the jam or jelly grants resistance for 5 minutes.

- **Specterflower**. This highly unusual plant grows in the deepest parts of dark forests, far from the eyes of civilization. The stalk is a blue-green color, and several pale leaves grow along the length. During nights of the full moon the plant buds a flower, which appears wispy and translucent. Attempting to touch the flower reveals that it is incorporeal, and has the substance of smoke. Come morning the flower disperses on the wind, sending the seeds of the flower on their path.

  The roots of the flower can be used to make an oil that allows blades to strike incorporeal creatures, called Ghostbane Oil. Using the roots of the specterflower, alchemists are capable of distilling an oil, that when applied to weapons, allows the weapon to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures. The benefit lasts only for a few swings.

- **Sun Peppers**. These small, yellow peppers are extremely spicy. Eating one restores 1d6+2 hp, but imparts a cumulative -2 penalty to all ability checks for the next hour.

  Can also be made into a crimson concentrate. The fumes produced by the solution are highly irritating to one's eyes. As an ***action***, you can splash the contents of this vial onto an adjacent creature or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack, treating the concentrate as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is blinded for 1 minute or it makes a DC 12 constitution check. Target may attempt the save again at the end of each of its rounds.

- **Sycamore Petals**. Sycamore petals are divine, holy plants. Fresh leaves, used within 3 days of picking, can be ground up and mixed into water. The result is the equivalent of a vial of holy water. Unlike actual holy water created by a cleric or paladin using a special ritual, this only remains effective for 10 minutes. After preparation.

- **Terrap**. Bush with dark broad leaves, which when made into a strong smelling oil, and given to an unconscious person, will immediately awaken the person. Takes about an hour to make. If prepared for longer (long rest), sealed properly and then allowed to ferment for a week it will develop a much stronger smell.

  When first opened, this sealed jar releases such an overwhelmingly antiseptic odor that it covers other smells until it disperses (1d6+1 rounds after opening). Creatures within 20 feet of the jar gain advantage on all saves against scent-based attacks while the sap’s odor remains, but they automatically fail any scent-based Perception checks during that time.

- **Torchstalk**. Non-magical mushroom that can serve as a torch. Takes 1d4-1 minutes to ignite, but burns for 24 hours shedding bright illumination in 10 ft radius. Has a sub species that explodes into choking spores after 30 seconds of burning, requiring anyone within 20 ft to make a DC 15 Constitution save to negate 1d10 poison damage. DC 15 Nature allows differentiation between the two types.

- **Troll Poppy**. A bright blue poppy flower commonly used to bribe trolls for safe passage through a monster-filled area. Trolls go wild for these flowers and will eat them as soon as they lay eyes on them. Usually found in large patches in open fields, 2d8 flowers can be harvested per 5 foot by 5 foot area. In addition to their use with trolls, the petals of troll poppies can be dried, crumbled, and smoked.

- **Waxworm**. The waxworm is not an herb, but a moth larvae. It can be squashed and use as a basis for a brew with healing properties. This brew, called hag’s brew, is a vile concoction that requires a DC 12 Constitution check to not instantly throw up. If the check is passed, it restores 6d4 hp.

- **White baneberry**. These berries are highly poisonous. A creature eating one must succeed with a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Eating several increases the DC by one per extra berry (max DC 19).

  However, they can also be brewed into a potion called Bloodletter's draught. Upon drinking, the imbiber immediately takes 1d6 damage. Every minute for the next 1d3+1 minutes later they are healed by the amount damage taken. This potion is used to ease the passing of those too weak to survive, but restores those who still have their strength to live back to health.

- **Wild Sageroot**. The most common ingredient found would be these light pink roots. They measure about 3 to 5 inches in length and have a smooth, fuzzy texture to them. When boiled with some other common herbs, the extract gives increased energy and dulls pain. Drinking this potion grants you 2d4+2 temporary hit points.

  Outside of combat or other strenuous activity, you retain these hit points for 1 hour or until you take sufficient damage. While in combat or similar situations which would keep your blood pumping and metabolism high, this time is reduced to 1 minute. After the duration of the potion expires (not when you lose the hit points), you must make a DC 15 Constitution save. Failure causes you to suffer 1 level of exhaustion. By letting it get more concentrated, it has a more potent effect. Preparing during a full day makes the potion grant 4d4+4 temporary hit points, with a DC 17, and two days preparation grant 6d4+6 temporary hit points and DC 19 to avoid exhaustion.

- **Willowshade Oil**. A dark blue oil can be extracted from the fruit of the Willowshade plant. It can be applied to a creature that has been petrified for less than 1 minute, causing the petrified condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature’s next turn.

- **Yewclaw**. The yellow bark of the yewclaw is a wonderful way to ease the strain of madness on an afflicted person. When dried, it can be burnt as an incense, and when deeply inhaled the resultant smoke calms the mind, suppressing a short-term madness completely, and easing a long-term madness for one hour.
