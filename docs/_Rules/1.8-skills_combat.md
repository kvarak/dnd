# Skills
Traits and skills that increase the efficacy and efficiency in combat. Whenever a skill refers to a save, the DC is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + the attribute you use for the weapon.

### When do I get combat skills?
You will get skill points to spend on combat skills mostly from you character choice.
- Each class receives a set number of skills at 1st level.
- When leveling up, classes get skill points to spend at different class levels. Some classes and archetypes may have class features that grant skills or skill points.
- In addition, during character creation, you might gain access to one or more skills.

### Spending skill points
Unless otherwise noted, each skill costs 1 skill point. To buy a skill you must know the skill right above it in the “skill tree”. You can save skill points, and are allowed to spend them at a later time, after finishing a long rest.

### Terms
- **Expertise**. You have advantage on checks using this skill.
- **Melee**. Melee weapons are used to attack targets within 5 ft.

The following traits are included in all weapon groups.
