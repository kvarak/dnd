      <li><em><strong>Arcing slash</strong></em>. When attacking with a two-handed axe, you may choose to target two creatures with a single attack.

      <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Defensive Posture</strong></em>. After using the Attack action with this weapon, you can spend a <em><strong>bonus action</strong></em> to bolster your defense.

      <li><em><strong>Lightning Slash</strong></em>. If an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity, you can use your <em><strong>reaction</strong></em> to make two attacks instead of one. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.</li>
      <li><em><strong>Parry</strong></em>. If a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your <em><strong>reaction</strong></em> to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. This can be used while in Defensive posture.</li>

With a <em><strong>bonus action</strong></em>, you can enter or leave the Oncoming Storm stance. While in this stance, the following applies.

      <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Conserve Momentum</strong></em>. When you miss with an attack you continue to whirl the chain in an effort to build energy towards your next attack.

      <li><em><strong>Disarm</strong></em>. As an <em><strong>action</strong></em>, you may try to disarm a creature. If it fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (targets choice), it is disarmed.</li>

      <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Defensive Fighter</strong></em>. You gain +1 bonus to AC while wielding a knife in one hand and nothing in your other hand.</li>
      <li><em><strong>Fast Hands</strong></em>. You can draw a knife as part of an attack, without using your item action.</li>
