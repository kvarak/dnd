        <h1 id="alchemist">Alchemist</h1>
  
  <p>A grinning gnome cackles with glee as he hurls a bomb into a group of charging goblins, blasting them into scorched chunks. He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, in the ensuing cloud of smoke.</p>
  
  <p>A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf’s side, which immediately stops bleeding.</p>
  
  <p>Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.</p>
  
  <h4 id="chemical-reactions">Chemical Reactions</h4>
  <p>One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists often utilize this knowledge to create bombs to use in combat and exploration.</p>
  
  <p>An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid right before use, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.</p>
  
  <p>More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances, some of which can replicate magical effects. Many become apothecaries, healing and creating potions for others. Apothecaries can use herbs and chemicals to heal wounds, cure diseases, and neutralize poison.</p>

  <p>You can never have more currently active concoctions than your Intelligence modifier + class level.</p>
  
  <p>At 1st level you can make bombs, elementary reagents, potions and poisons. At higher levels you learn to augment your concoctions and create new ones.</p>
  
  <p>When your concoctions call for a saving throw, its save DC is calculated as follows:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Alchemy save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

  <h4 id="bomb">Bomb</h4>
  <p>These volatile alchemical bombs are ranged weapons with the finesse and thrown (range 20/60) properties. On a hit, the target takes your alchemy die + your Intelligence modifier fire damage. All creatures within a 5 ft radius of the original target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a failed save and none on a successful one.</p>
  
  <p>If you miss your attack roll with a bomb, there is a 50% chance the throw was not hard enough to cause the bomb to explode. Otherwise it continues up to your maximum throwing distance before exploding. Roll an attack roll for each possible target in the path to see if it explodes before.</p>
  
  <p>You cannot throw more than one bomb per round. You do not have disadvantage when throwing a bomb while within 5 feet of a hostile creature. Creatures not proficient with alchemical bombs have disadvantage on attack rolls made with them.</p>
  
  <h4 id="elementary-reagent">Elementary Reagent</h4>
  <p>An elementary reagent is a versatile concoction which can be finalized into one of several different items depending on the final ingredient added when used. Preparing the final product is an <strong><em>item action</em></strong> that requires both hands (or an assistant).</p>
  
  <p>After the final mix is made, the concoction has to be used within a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can make the reagents into one of the following:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Adhesive</strong>. As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you can stick two surfaces together, requiring a Strength check against your Alchemy save DC to separate. Lasts 1 hour or until you separate them chemically as an <strong><em>action</em></strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Aromatic</strong>. You can reproduce a non-harmful, non-magical scent you remember for a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Corrosive</strong>. An unstable vial of Acid.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Endotherm</strong>. You mix a potion that rapidly cools, decompressing the surrounding air with a loud bang that can be heard within a number of feet equal to your Intelligence modifier times 100 feet.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Incendiary</strong>. An unstable flask of Alchemist’s Fire.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Luminescent</strong>. You mix a luminous concoction that sheds dim light in a radius equal to five times your Intelligence modifier and bright light for half of that. This effect lasts 1 hour or until the vial is broken.</p>
  
  <h4 id="poison">Poison</h4>
  <p>Poison concoctions can be applied to slashing or piercing weapons. As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you can apply one of these poisons to your weapon or to three pieces of ammunition, where it lasts for 10 minutes before it becomes inert.</p>
  
  <p>If you damage a living creature with the weapon, this poison deals additional poison damage equal to your alchemy die.</p>
  
  <h4 id="potion">Potion</h4>
  <p>You can mix together herbs to create potions that cure ailments and injuries. If such a potion is ingested as an <strong><em>item action</em></strong>, it heals damage equal to your alchemy die.</p>

  <h3 id="studious-expertise">Studious Expertise</h3>
  <p>From 1st level you have advantage on any ability check you make with your alchemist’s supplies, as well as any ability check to identify herbs, poisons or other alchemical substances.</p>
  
  <h3 id="field-of-study">Field of Study</h3>
  <p>While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study from apothecary, mad bomber, poisoner and transmuter. Your field choice grants you features at 2nd level and then again at 7th, 10th, and 17th level.</p>
  
  <h3 id="discoveries-1">Discoveries</h3>
  <p>In the course of your research, you have made a number of <a href="#discovery">discoveries</a> regarding the nature of alchemy. At 3rd level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.</p>
  
  <p>Additionally, when you learn a new discovery, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p>
  
  <h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
  <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
  
  <h3 id="chemical-distillation">Chemical Distillation</h3>
  <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can use your alchemist’s supplies to purify water, rendering it drinkable if a little bland in taste.</p>
  
  <h3 id="brew-potions">Brew Potions</h3>
  <p>During times of downtime you can prepare alchemical reagents needed to brew potions of different types. The currently availabe reagents are represented by <strong><em>Alchemy points</em></strong>. The maximum number of <strong><em>Alchemy points</em></strong> you can have at any time is equal to half your class level.</p>
  
  <p>From 6th level, you learn to create potions with ease and speed. During a couple of hours time, or during a long rest, you can use your alchemist’s supplies and spend your <strong><em>Alchemy points</em></strong> to brew potions. Potions retain potency 24 hours, after which they become inert. Unless otherwise noted, their effects last for 1 hour.</p>
  
  <p>You regain <strong><em>Alchemy points</em></strong> after a long rest. See <em>Rest Additions</em> for more info.</p>
  
  <p>Brewing the following potions cost 1 alchemy point.
  Any mundane alchemical substance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bear’s Endurance</strong>. The target gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the effect ends.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bull’s Strength</strong>. Target’s carrying capacity doubles.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Curative</strong>. A creature that drinks this elixir heals 2 [hit die] + 4 hit points.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Diver</strong>. The target gains the ability to hold its breath twice as long as normal, i.e. for a number of minutes equal to 2 + twice its Constitution bomns.</p>
  
  <p>From level 9, you can brew the following potions, for 2 alchemy points each.
  <strong>Neutralizer</strong>. A creature that drinks this elixir gains advantage on saving throws against poison. If you are poisoned when you drink this potion, you may immediately make a new saving throw.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Preventative</strong>. A creature that drinks this elixir gains advantage on saving throws against disease. If you are diseased when you drink this remedy, you may immediately make a new saving throw.</p>
  
  <p>At level 14, you can brew the following potions, for 3 alchemy points each.
  <strong>Gaseous Form</strong>. The drinker and along with everything worn, transforms into a misty cloud for the duration, as the spell.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Haste</strong>. As the spell.</p>
  
  <h3 id="evasion">Evasion</h3>
  <p>Beginning at 13th level, your experience with avoiding your own bombs’ explosions has granted you the ability to nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell.</p>
  
  <p>When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
  
  <h3 id="philosophers-stone">Philosopher’s Stone</h3>
  <p>At 20th level, you unlock the secrets of alchemy. Using your alchemist’s supplies and 1000 gp worth of materials, you can spend 1 week of work creating a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of elemental energy encased in a fist-sized, glowing jewel. Your philosopher’s stone only works in your possession, and you can only have one at a time. To any other creature, it is just an ordinary (if beautiful) gemstone. As long as you possess your philosopher’s stone, you gain the following benefits.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>You age 10 times slower than normal, and your age cannot be magically changed.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease and poison.</li>
    <li>As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you can transmute a vial of water into any potion you can brew, which becomes inert after 24 hours. You must complete a long rest before you can do this again.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The philosopher’s stone also has devastating destructive potential. As a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong> when you throw a bomb, you can replace its reagent with the philosopher’s stone, creating a massive bomb. This bomb has a blast radius of 500 ft, dealing 10d10 + 50 fire damage to all creatures in the area.</p>

  <h1><a class="internal-link" name="apothecary">Apothecary</a></h1>
  
  <p>Many practically-minded alchemists decide to assume the role of the apothecary. An adventuring party always needs a healer, and clerics might be in short supply. On their downtime, such alchemists have a marketable skill to depend upon for income. Apothecaries are constantly at work studying potions and herbology. In order to learn how to heal the body, an apothecary must learn how the body works. This often requires carving boldly upon the corpses of the dead to further understand how they behave while living.</p>

  <h3 id="bonus-proficiencies">Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
  <p>When you select this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Medicine. If you have access to your alchemist’s supplies when making an ability check to diagnose or treat a creature, you gain advantage to the check.</p>
  
  <h3 id="painkiller-bomb">Painkiller Bomb</h3>
  <p>At 2nd level, you can create bombs which spray an analgesic oil. When creating a bomb, you can replace its contents with this oil, changing it to a painkiller bomb. The bomb can then be thrown as normal or splashed on an adjacent creature.</p>
  
  <p>You have advantage on attack rolls made to hit a willing creature in combat with this bomb, while outside of combat, you automatically hit. Painkiller bombs do not have a blast radius and deal no damage. Instead, on a hit, the target gains temporary hit points for 1 minute, equal to your alchemy die + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
  
  <h3 id="potion-focus">Potion Focus</h3>
  <p>From 2nd level, whenever you administer a Potion Concoction to another creature, the target heals an additional amount of hp equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
  
  <h3 id="quick-hands">Quick Hands</h3>
  <p>Starting at 7th level, as a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong>, you can drink a potion or safely pass a potion to or from a willing creature within 15 feet of you that has at least 1 hand free. As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you can pass a number of potions or bombs up to your Dexterity modifier to willing creatures within range.</p>
  
  <h3 id="surgical-precision">Surgical Precision</h3>
  <p>Your skill with small and precise tools is so refined that it shows even in battle, Starting at 7th level, as long as you are using a finesse or light melee weapon, you can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action. In addition, once per turn, if you have advantage on the attack roll, you can deal extra damage to target equal to your alchemy die.</p>
  
  <h3 id="bonus-potions">Bonus Potions</h3>
  <p>At 10th level, you can additionally brew the following potions with your Brew potions feature:
  <strong>Improved Curative</strong>. A creature that drinks this elixir heals 4[hit die] + 4 hit points. (1 alchemy point)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Greater Curative</strong>. A creature that drinks this elixir heals 8[hit die] + 10 hit points. (3 alchemy points)</p>
  
  <h3 id="panacea">Panacea</h3>
  <p>At 17th level, during a long rest, using 5 <strong><em>alchemy points</em></strong> and materials worth at least 500 gp (which are consumed upon use), you can distill the essence of universal healing, the panacea. When a creature drinks this potion, they instantly gain the following benefits:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Any reduction to the creature’s ability scores or hit points is ended.</li>
    <li>The creature’s hit points are restored to maximum.</li>
    <li>The creature is no longer cursed, blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or petrified. It loses all levels of exhaustion.</li>
    <li>All the creature’s diseases are cured.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The panacea must be consumed within 24 hours, after which it becomes inert. You can reactivate it during a long rest, with the same <strong><em>alchemy point</em></strong> cost, but no additional gp cost.</p>

  <p>By 2nd level, you have perfected the ability to reanimate corpses and modify them. During a long rest, you can alchemically reanimate a fresh cadaver if you have your alchemist’s supplies, leatherworker’s tools and a humanoid corpse. When you do so, it has the base statistics listed below. You can only have one cadaver at a time as they need constant upkeep.</p>
  
  <p>In combat, the cadaver shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong> on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action.</p>
  
  <p>If you spend a short rest with your leatherworker’s tools on your cadaver, it regains 2d6 hit points.</p>

  <h5 id="hiding-the-undead">Hiding the undead</h5>
  <p>Your cadaver is created by science, but unfortunately people often associate undead with evil. Luckily your cadaver’s undead nature is easy to hide, at least if reasonably fresh. All it takes is covering it with clothes, armor, bandages and maybe a mask or hat.</p>
  
  <h3 id="revival-concoction">Revival Concoction</h3>
  <p>Also from 2nd level, you learn how to prepare an additional concoction, the revival concoction, which can be used as an <strong><em>action</em></strong> to repair your cadaver.</p>
  
  <p>If your cadaver has died within the last hour the concoction can be used to restore it to unlife. After 1 minute it is revived with all its hit points restored.</p>
  
  <p>Using the concoction on a “living” cadaver grants it temporary hit points equal to 3 times your class level. The temporary hit points are not gained until after 1 minute, and they last indefinitely.</p>
  
  <h3 id="corpsecrafting-infusions">Corpsecrafting Infusions</h3>
  <p>At 7th level when you create your cadaver, you can choose to add a variety of boons and features to it by using corpsecrafting infusions. When creating a cadaver you can apply one effect form the infusions list. You can apply one additional infusion at 10th level. Some infusions can be applied twice, with additional effects.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Draining Touch</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, its unarmed attacks instead do 3d6 necrotic damage. If applied twice, the cadaver gains health equal to half the damage dealt with this attack.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enhanced Vitality</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, double its hit points. If applied twice, double it again.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Extraordinary Activation</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, it gains the ‘Ability Score Improvement’ feature. You can only apply this infusion once.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Galvanism</strong>. Whenever the cadaver is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt. If applied twice, it also gains resistance to acid damage.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Martial Memories</strong>. The cadaver gains an additional attack every time it takes the attack action.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Necrotic Regeneration</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, if it has more than 0 hit points it regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier back at the start of your turn. The amount regenerated increases to twice your Intelligence modifier if applied twice.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Undead Constitution</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, it gains immunity to the charmed, exhaustion, paralyzed and petrified condition as well as resistance to necrotic damage. If applied twice, it also gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks.</p>
  
  <h3 id="unnatural-intellect">Unnatural Intellect</h3>
  <p>Starting at 10th level, your cadaver gains some semblance of thought. Your cadaver can now act on its own, not needing to be commanded with your bonus action to use its own actions.</p>
  
  <h3 id="magnum-opus">Magnum Opus</h3>
  <p>At 17th level, you have developed some extraordinary infusions for your cadaver. Choose one of the Magnum Opus infusions to give to a cadaver you create.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Magnum Opus: Incorporeal</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, it gains a flying speed of 30ft and becomes immune to the grappled, prone and restrained condition. It also can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, taking 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Magnum Opus: Harbinger</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, anytime it kills another humanoid, the creature will rise as a zombie with one hit point at the start of your next turn. It is under your command and uses your initiative count.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Magnum Opus: Macabre Doppelganger</strong>. When you apply this infusion to your cadaver, your cadaver gains a new strange ability. When you die, your cadaver can turn itself into an unnatural imitation of you by consuming your fresh (within the hour) corpse. When it does this, it gains all your statistics as well as your behaviours and memories but not your appearance. Over the course of the next week, the cadaver slowly changes to look identical to your original body.</p>
  
  <p>If you manage to be resurrected before the cadaver finishes changing, the cadaver reverts back to normal, if however, the cadaver finishes its transformation before you are resurrected your soul is thrust into the cadaver.</p>
  
  <p>During the transformation, the cadaver can’t create another cadaver using its ‘Animate cadaver’ feature.</p>

  <h3 id="makeshift-bombs">Makeshift Bombs</h3>
  <p>At 2nd level, the creation of bombs is so ingrained in your memory that you can do it in an instant. As long as you have alchemist’s supplies and a component pouch, you can create a makeshift bomb as an <strong><em>item action</em></strong>. The bomb does not count against you daily limit of concoctions, only damages a single target on a hit and cannot be modified by any of your discoveries.</p>
  
  <h3 id="demolition">Demolition</h3>
  <p>At 7th level, you learn to use your bombs to damage and destroy structures. You now make your bombs to accept fuses of various lengths. As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you can set a bomb and light its fuse, which has a duration of your choice between 1 round and 5 minutes. Upon detonation, this bomb deals its damage as normal, but also deals double damage to any nonmagical object within 5 feet of it that isn’t being worn or carried and also ignores its damage immunities. For rules on objects and their hit points, see pages 246 and 247 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p>
  
  <h3 id="expanding-blast">Expanding blast</h3>
  <p>At 10th level, you have figured out how to make larger casings for your bombs. The blast radius is now 10 feet. Creatures within a 5 foot radius take full damage on a failed save and half on a successful one. Even though you create the bombs with larger casing, you can remove it at the time of throwing to get a regular radius bomb.</p>
  
  <h3 id="big-bombs">Big bombs</h3>
  <p>Beginning at 17th level, you can combine two non makeshift bombs into one. Combine damage and effect from both bombs. Any saves against the bombs are made at disadvantage.</p>

  <h3 id="poison-resistance">Poison Resistance</h3>
  <p>Also from 2nd level, you gain resistance to poison and advantage on saving throws against poison.</p>

  <p>At 10th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poison condition.</p>
  
  <h3 id="powder-poison">Powder Poison</h3>
  <p>At 17th level, you learn how to create more versatile versions of your poison concoctions. Whenever you use a poison, you can choose to use it in three different ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can apply it on your weapon as usual.</li>
    <li>You can use it more concentrated, for a more lethal effect when ingested. The poison’s damage is doubled, and any saves a target would need to make has disadvantage.</li>
    <li>You can use a small cone to blow the poison out as a fine mist in a 15-foot-cone. Any target in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your alchemy save DC. Any creature that fails the save is affected by any poison as normal, except its duration is only 1 round. A creature that succeeds is unaffected by the poison.</li>

  <p>From 2nd level, when you choose this field of study, you learn how to prepare an additional concoction, the hallucinogen.</p>
  
  <p>A hallucinogen is made in a powder form that you can blow onto an adjacent creature. If the creature fails a Wisdom saving throw against your Alchemy save DC, it gains the new <strong><em>Compliant</em></strong> condition for 1 minute. This is a charm effect.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="invade-mind">Invade Mind</h3>
  <p>Also from 2nd level, your ability to alter a creature’s mind allows you to control compliant creatures. As an <strong><em>action</em></strong>, you may target one creature within 30 feet who is compliant or charmed by you, and cause one of the following effects to occur:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The target gets advantage or disadvantage on their next saving throw, ability check or attack roll. Your choice on whether it is made with advantage or disadvantage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can speak telepathically with the creature while it is within 30 feet for the next minute or until it is no longer compliant or charmed. When you activate this ability, you learn the target’s surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about), and can do so again as an <strong><em>action</em></strong> while this ability is active.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can see through the creature’s eyes and hear what it hears for the next minute or until you end this ability as a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong> on your turn. While this is active, you are blind and deafened.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again with the same compliant/charmed effect active.</p>
  
  <h3 id="vertigo">Vertigo</h3>
  <p>At 7th level, you can tap into a mind you have subdued at the moment of clarity and wrack them with pain. As a <strong><em>reaction</em></strong> when a creature within 30 feet, who is compliant or charmed by you ends that effect, you can use your reaction to deal 3d8 psychic damage to the target. You can choose to instead use this feature as a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong> while the creature is compliant/charmed by you, ending the effect.</p>
  
  <h3 id="advanced-sway">Advanced Sway</h3>
  <p>Starting at 10th level, you have perfected pheromones that can pierce through even the strongest minds. A creature who is normally immune to the charmed condition is not immune to effects of your abilities.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, when a creature is made compliant or charmed by you, you may use an <strong><em>action</em></strong> and expend a hallucinogen concoction to automatically reset the duration of the spell or effect as if just cast.</p>
  
  <h3 id="dazing-vertigo">Dazing Vertigo</h3>
  <p>By 17th level, your abilities to injure minds and manipulate brains allows you to punish those who would resist your charms. The damage of your Vertigo increases to 6d8 + your Intelligence modifier, and the target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>

  <h3 id="bonus-proficiency">Bonus proficiency</h3>
  <p>When you select this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Arcana.</p>
  
  <h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
  <p>Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast spells.</p>
  
  <h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
  <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip at 10th level.</p>
  
  <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned  with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>
  
  <h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
  <p>You have a spellbook containing three 1st-level wizard spells from the <strong><em>transmutation</em></strong> or <strong><em>abjuration</em></strong> schools. The Transmuter spellcasting table show show many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.</p>
  
  <p>You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your alchemist level. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
  
  <h4 id="learning-spells">Learning Spells</h4>
  <p>Each time you gain an alchemist level, you can add one new transmutation or abjuration spell from the wizard spell list to your spellbook. It must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Like a wizard, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. However, gold and time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
  
  <h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
  <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li>
    <li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="spellcasting-components">Spellcasting components</h4>
  <p>All your spells gain material components and lose verbal components. The material components are stored in pre-measured doses for quick access in small vials, packets, and other containers within easy reach on your person. Where incantations or prayer cause magic to work for other spellcasters, it is the materials and science that do that for an alchemist.</p>

  <h3 id="transmuters-stone">Transmuter’s Stone</h3>
  <p>Starting at 7th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession.</p>
  
  <p>When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.</li>
    <li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered.</li>
    <li>Proficiency with Constitution saving throws.</li>
    <li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p>
  
  <h3 id="shapechanger">Shapechanger</h3>
  <p>At 10th level, you can brew a mutagenic elixir in addition to your other concoctions. This elixir affects you as a <em>polymorph</em> spell, with the exception that you can only transform into a creature with CR 1 or lower and you retain your intelligence.</p>
  
  <h3 id="master-transmuter">Master Transmuter</h3>
  <p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your <strong><em>action</em></strong> to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Major Transformation</strong>. You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Restore Life</strong>. You cast the <em>raise dead</em> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Restore Youth</strong>. You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</p>

  <h3 id="acid-bomb">Acid Bomb</h3>
  <p>You can make bombs which spray a corrosive acid. As a <strong><em>bonus action</em></strong> when you throw a bomb, you can replace the bomb’s explosive reagent with an acidic one, changing it to an acid bomb. An acid bomb deals acid damage instead of fire damage. Additionally, the target, as well as all creatures within the blast radius that fail their saving throws, take an additional 1d8 acid damage at the start of your next turn.</p>

  <h3 id="arcane-study">Arcane Study</h3>
  <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard’s spell list. Your spellcasting ability for these cantrips is Intelligence.</p>
  
  <h3 id="aqua-fortis">Aqua Fortis</h3>
  <p>Using your alchemist’s supplies and 20 gp worth of materials, you can spend 1 hour creating a vial of aqua fortis, a very strong acid that rapidly dissolves organic material and most metals. This vial can be splashed or thrown at a creature like common acid. On a hit, a creature takes 3d6 acid damage, followed by an additional 2d6 acid damage at the start of your next turn and another 1d6 acid damage at the start of the turn after that.</p>
  
  <p>If a vial of aqua fortis is splashed on a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried, it will will dissolve a 1-foot cube of it. If splashed on a suit of armor armor or a shield, the object takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. If splashed on a weapon, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. It has no effect on gold, glass, stone, and adamantine objects or magical items.</p>
  
  <h3 id="argentum-sanguine">Argentum sanguine</h3>
  <h4 id="silver-blood">“Silver blood”</h4>
  <p>You have imbued your very essence with alchemical silver and cannot be infected with lycanthropy or vampirism. Any such creature that bites you takes damage equal to your Constitution modifier (min 1). Damage from your weapon or spell attacks is not reduced by the natural damage resistance of a lycanthrope or vampire.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, this interferes with magic that attempt to control your mind. You have advantage on saves against all such attempts.</p>
  
  <h3 id="blast-coat">Blast Coat</h3>
  <p>You have developed a coating for your coat, specially treated to protect you from your own explosions. You automatically succeed any saving throws against your own bombs. If can only be applied to cloth, and if you need to apply the coating on a new item, this takes a full day. Even if the coating could be worn by anyone, it is a bit toxic and would probably kill people not used to being close these kind of chemicals.</p>
  
  <h3 id="bomb-trap">Bomb trap</h3>
  <p>You can set up a bomb to explode when someone moves past or over it. This is done with a tripwire, a buried mine or any other trap construction appropriate for the location.</p>
  
  <p>You set it up in 1 minute, and you can have a number of traps up to your intelligence modifier at one time. When a creature of Small size or larger moves at the spot where your trap is set, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes full damage from the bomb, or half as much on a successful save. A creature can detect the presence of a trapped bomb with a Perception check opposed by your Stealth check.</p>
  
  <h3 id="clotting-agent">Clotting Agent</h3>
  <p>You have developed a serum that protects you from harm. Your maximum hp increases by half your Alchemist level (rounded up.)</p>
  
  <h3 id="compounding-formulary">Compounding Formulary</h3>
  <p><em>Prerequisite: Brew Potions feature</em></p>
  
  <p>You can create potions in powdered rather than liquid form if desired. The potions can be used for two days before becoming inert. However, it takes 2 rounds to prepare them for use, and so prepared, they must be used within a minute.</p>
  
  <h3 id="craft-homunculus">Craft Homunculus</h3>
  <p>Using a special alchemical process requiring 8 hours of work, you can create a homunculus (Monster Manual pg. 188.) A homunculus functions as a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, with the following differences:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Your homunculus is a construct and cannot assume a different form.</li>
    <li>You cannot dismiss your homunculus as you would a familiar.</li>
    <li>When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated as a ritual requiring 1 hour of work.</li>
    <li>Your homunculus is able to take the Attack action on its turn.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="detonation-theorem">Detonation Theorem</h3>
  <p>When you throw a bomb, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll, instead of Strength or Dexterity.</p>
  
  <h3 id="extend-potion">Extend Potion</h3>
  <p>Whenever you drink a potion with a duration, the duration is doubled.</p>
  
  <h3 id="flashbang">Flashbang</h3>
  <p>You can include bright flashing powder in your bombs. This allows you to make you bombs blind targets who fail a Constitution save. Targets gain a new save at the end of each of their rounds to end the condition. Creatures with darkvision have disadvantage on saves against this type of bomb.</p>
  
  <h3 id="glassfoot-bomb">Glassfoot Bomb</h3>
