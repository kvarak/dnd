You affect it in one of the following ways:<br><br>&nbsp; ♦ You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You instantaneously extinguish the flame.<br>&nbsp; ♦ The flame flashes brightly and/or a cloud of colorful smoke is formed (one or two colors of your choice). All creatures within 5 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. This smoke can be created into a simple, two-dimensional image for as long as you concentrate (up to 1 minute), or you can use the flash and smoke to hide a quick escape.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You protect the flame, preventing it from being extinguished by nonmagical breezes or gusts of air. This effect lasts for up to 1 hour.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You change the color or the flames. The change lasts for up to 1 hour.<br>&nbsp; ♦ You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for as long as you concentrate (up to 10 minutes).<br>&nbsp; ♦ You cause the flame to reduce in size and light to that of a match, or increase in brightness – but not size – to that of a light spell. This effect lasts for up to 8 hours. Reducing a fire also reduces its consumption of fuel by half, with the effect of doubling its remaining duration, while increasing a fire doubles its fuel consumption. This spell doesn’t change the heat output of the fire.<br><br>&nbsp; If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss an effect as an action. <p><b>At Higher Levels</b><br>At 5th level, you can cause two effects or target two flames at the same time.

As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<br>&nbsp; <b>Flood.</b>You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br>&nbsp; <b>Part Water.</b> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br>&nbsp; <b>Redirect Flow. </b>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br>&nbsp; <b>Whirlpool.</b> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br>&nbsp; When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br>&nbsp; The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</td><td>4</td><td>Shanties, Ocean, Yes,Land - Coast,Land - Swamp,Tides, Oceanic, Ancient Toad,Dagon,Keeper of Depths, Archaeologist, Nereid, </td><td>Shanties</td><td>Ocean</td><td>Yes,Land - Coast,Land - Swamp,Tides</td><td>No</td><td>Oceanic</td><td>Ancient Toad,Dagon,Keeper of Depths</td><td>Yes</td><td>Archaeologist</td><td>No</td><td>Nereid</td><td>No</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><h4><a class="internal-link" name="ControlWeather">Control Weather</a></h4><a class="internal-link" name="ControlWeather"><i>Level: 8</i><br><b>Casting time: </b>10 minutes<br><b>Target: </b>In range<br><b>Range: </b>5 miles<br><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)<br><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 8 hours</a></td><td>You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall are blown in the wind's direction. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected and automatically miss. The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay (including creatures in gaseous form). Small or smaller flying creatures or objects, can’t pass through the wall.<br>&nbsp; ♦ By casting the spell as a 4th level or higher spell, you can set the origin and direction of the wind at any point within 300 ft.

Using your action to see auras or identifying items, you can also see if the target is affected by a curse. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can determine the type of curse and its effects. The spell doesn’t function when used on an artifact.<br>&nbsp; ♦ See Invisibility. While sensing magic, you also see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.<br>&nbsp; ♦ Track Magic. You can detect the lingering trace of a magic aura that you have sensed previously. If the aura has been there within the last hour, you can observe a sparkling golden trail that leads in the direction the item, or the caster of that effect went after casting it. This allows you to follow the trail at your normal speed. If you move faster than your normal speed (for example, by using the Dash action), you lose the trail.

When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 ft radius. If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle.

If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.

Although it can’t create fire, it can make use of any existing fire. Choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube, such as a torch, lantern, candle or campfire. You affect it in one of the following ways:<br>&nbsp; ♦ The fire explodes with a dazzling firework of colors. Each creature other than you within 30 feet of the target location must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn. By spending a bonus action before casting the spell you can warn your allies, allowing them an automatic success on the save.<br>&nbsp; ♦ Thick black smoke spreads out from the target flame in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.<br>&nbsp; ♦ The fire source bursts into a large conflagration for a moment. Each creature other than you within 10 feet of the source takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as much with a successful Dexterity saving throw. For each spell slot used higher than 1st level, the spell does an additional 1d6 fire damage.<p><b>Versatile casting:</b><br>&nbsp; ♦ By casting the spell as a 4th level spell, you can cause the fire to become covered in a multi-hued veil of dancing flames for as long as you concentrate (up to 1 minute). Creatures within 30 feet of the fire who see it must make Wisdom saving throws at the beginning of each of their turns. A creature that fails the saving throw stands transfixed and can do nothing except watch the fire until the beginning of its next turn. While a creature is transfixed, it has disadvantage on saving throws against enchantment spells. Any physical attack or attack that triggers a saving throw against a fire-fascinated creature automatically breaks the effect on that creature. Likewise, interposing a solid barrier between a fascinated creature and the veil of flames breaks the effect.<br>&nbsp; ♦ By casting the spell as a 6th level spell, you can cause a great fiery tendril, 20 feet long, to lash out from the source of fire for as long as you concentrate (up to 1 minute). The tendril tries to wrap around a target creature within its reach. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it takes 6d6 fire damage and is restrained until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, it repeats the saving throw; it escapes if the save succeeds, but it takes another 6d6 fire damage if the saving throw fails.

If you cast the spell on an area of ground, it becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make this save the first time it enters the area on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud. If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>&nbsp; ♦ By casting the spell as a 5th level spell, you can also turn mud into rock. Choose an area of non magical mud or quicksand that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube within 120 ft, and turn it into soft stone. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a Strength check (DC 20) or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space.<br>&nbsp; ♦ By casting the spell as a 7th level spell, you can disintegrate stone. You touch a Large or smaller stone object, or section of stone made primarily of stone, such as a stone wall, which  crumbles into dust. If cast on a creature made from stone, the creature may make a Constitution saving throw, suffering 15d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></td><td>1</td><td>Agriculture,Dwarven rune, Yes,Land - Mountain,Land - Underdark, Oozemaster,Stone, Eternal Citadel, Smith, Oread, </td><td>No</td><td>Agriculture,Dwarven rune</td><td>Yes,Land - Mountain,Land - Underdark</td><td>No</td><td>Oozemaster,Stone</td><td>Eternal Citadel</td><td>Yes</td><td>Smith</td><td>No</td><td>Oread</td><td>No</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><h4><a class="internal-link" name="Stoneskin">Stoneskin</a></h4><a class="internal-link" name="Stoneskin"><i>Level: 4</i><br><b>Casting time: </b>Action<br><b>Target: </b>1 target<br><b>Range: </b>Touch<br><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)<br><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 1 hour</a></td><td>This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone.

If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</td><td>6</td><td>Desert,Fortune,Hunting,Nature,Survival,Tempest, Autumnal,Dune child,Pandemonic,Storm,Wishcrafter, Oberon,Pharaoh,Storm Lord, </td><td>No</td><td>Desert,Fortune,Hunting,Nature,Survival,Tempest</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Autumnal,Dune child,Pandemonic,Storm,Wishcrafter</td><td>Oberon,Pharaoh,Storm Lord</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><h4><a class="internal-link" name="WoodShape">Wood Shape</a></h4><a class="internal-link" name="WoodShape"><i>Level: 3</i><br><b>Casting time: </b>Action<br><b>Target: </b>1 wooden object<br><b>Range: </b>Touch<br><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a piece of softwood)<br><b>Duration: </b>Instantaneous</a></td><td>You touch a wooden object of Medium size or smaller or a section of wood no more than 5' in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose.
